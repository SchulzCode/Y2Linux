# Y2B-250 — ARM time32 nanosleep fix

> Subsequent owner hardware report confirms working sleep and increasing BEAT/uptime. [M1 core result and exact evidence limits](../knowledge/m1-runtime-hardware-result.md). The report does not independently pin the flashed candidate hash; offline artifact identities below remain unchanged.

2026-09-08. [Issue #21](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/21). **Offline candidate ready; not flashed.**

## Evidence and exact change

[Owner-reported Y2B-245 screen](../knowledge/y2b245-hardware-result.md) proves the real renderer, PID1 and proc/sysfs mounts, then stops with sleep -38 / ENOSYS at BEAT 0. No increasing heartbeat is claimed.

ARM EABI syscall 162 is `sys_nanosleep_time32`. The old linked table targets the weak ENOSYS alias at `0xc00309a8`. The one kernel config change is `CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME: n → y`; `CONFIG_POSIX_TIMERS` remains disabled and is not required. No PID1, timer driver, DTS, framebuffer or watchdog code changed.

Code/build source commit `dff1e82`. Previously audited Linux v6.18 commit `7d0a66e4bb9081d75c82ec4957c50034cb0ea449`, Clang/LLD 20.1.8 and the locked environment are unchanged. Source/toolchain hashes are trusted from the prior audit, not recomputed across the source tree.

## Targeted validation

- Exactly one clean build; resolved config comparison has exactly one changed option.
- Linked table slot 162 now targets real, non-weak `sys_nanosleep_time32` at `0xc0066500`; `sys_ni_syscall` is separately at `0xc0030aac`.
- Three syscall regression tests pass: real built mapping, rejection of disabled time32, rejection of table bytes redirected to ENOSYS despite correct config and an available real function.
- The same check rejects the actual old kernel even with a fabricated enabled config.
- Production ARM PID1 regression passes all nine syscall-fixture scenarios with console writes trapped. ARM init self-test passes. These are host tests, not proof of timer IRQs on the Y2.
- D08/layout validation and final Android/MTK BOOTIMG wrappers, padding/read tail and 16 MiB partition bounds pass. No build warnings/errors.
- DTB, init executable, cpio and gzip are byte-identical to Y2B-245. Emitted watchdog instructions match the previous candidate. PRELOADER/LK/partition layout are unchanged; no device operation occurred.
- No unrelated full-suite, source/ROM/recovery audit or second reproducibility build was performed.

## Retained candidate

**1,093,632 bytes**; SHA-256 `074c3e6946e6e8ac61bc1df0da4fa53807071dd50ae3db4def97563c9207afce`.

The separate bundle retains ELFs, resolved config, source archive, input lock, logs, layout.json, iteration.json, old-syscall.json and SHA256SUMS.

D08 static RAM remains `[0x80000000,0x81800000)` and `[0x84000000,0x84080000)`, with `[0x80000000,0x80004000)` reserved. CPU0 only, appended DTB, no ATAG import or expansion. BOOTIMG remains within EMMC_USER `[0x01d80000,0x02d80000)`.

## Expected next screen

LK logo → kernel/PID1 status with mounts → successful sleep return, increasing BEAT/FRAME and changing runtime fields → STOP: RESTORE ANDROID after 50 successful sleeps. Existing external 60-second limit takes precedence over iteration completion. No automatic reset/restore.

This removes the confirmed ENOSYS cause. Actual timer wakeup and progress still require the next separately authorized device trial; a frozen screen must be recorded as new evidence. No automatic flash or M2 work.

## Reproduce this localized iteration

Use an unused output directory and the existing audited cache:

```sh
python3 tools/build/run.py --output out/m1-y2b250-time32 -- sh /project/tools/build/build.sh test_sleep_syscall.py test_pid1.py
```

Omitting test patterns retains the full suite for architecture changes and release validation.
