# M2-BASELINE-01 — integrated Linux 6.18 core development baseline

2026-09-10, starting from clean main **4dde305**. **Offline validated; owner flash
and all new hardware results pending.** M1 remains COMPLETE, M2 ACTIVE. This
[scope audit](../planning/roadmap-gap-audit.md#m2-baseline-01-integration-authorization--2026-09-10)
supersedes separate M2-INPUT-01/USBACM-04 prerequisite flashes. It does not close
M2 or change the blueprint, rootfs/application plan, or M3/M4/M5 gates.

## What actually changed

At 4dde305 only CPU0/GIC/GPT, stopped AP watchdog, inherited text, guarded USB
PIO/ACM/PID1 logs, offline reconnect and polled navigation were implemented.
The following are now compiled and connected in the same candidate. “Integrated”
is a source/build result, never confirmation on this older physical Y2.

| Subsystem | Integrated design / first-boot interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| CPU/timer/watchdog | Four CPUs using upstream MediaTek release keys at SRAMROM `10202000`; no hotplug/SPM power sequence. Proven GPT retained, upstream dummy per-CPU clockevents plus ARM tick broadcast are linked. No invented architected-timer IRQ. Exact early AP watchdog-stop instructions still validated; no production watchdog/reboot driver. |
| USB/logging | Original guarded unplugged PHY wake, MUSB PIO and ACM; USBACM-04 one-reconnect lifecycle retained. Startup snapshot now precedes display/storage device probes. PWRAP and clock reads use their shared owners. USB deadline 295s from its early start; PID1 285 heartbeat iterations; neither replaces the owner's wall-clock cutoff. |
| CCF | Read inherited ARM/MAIN/UNIV/MM/MSDC PLLs and AXI mux; BSP-derived fractional/divider arithmetic, no PLL/CPU retuning. Real AXI parents and `/16` I2C contract replace donor's approximate 66MHz placeholder. Reviewed infra/peri/MM gates. Unresolved MM/PWM parents report zero, never a fabricated VENCPLL rate. Shared SMI/mutex gates remain on for this bounded LK handoff. |
| GPIO/pinctrl/EINT | Minimal reviewed navigation, I2C0/1, SD1 and LCM mux/bias groups; gpio-ranges and pinctrl ownership. MT6582 register layout with upstream 6.18 EINT library. Parent SPI113 HIGH; PMIC EINT25 HIGH, wheel55 FALLING. Keypad and eMMC retain LK pad setup. No generic full-pad/drive-strength claim. |
| PWRAP/MT6323 | One serialized WACS2 regmap owner, shared with USB; upstream MT6397-family MFD and MT6323 regulators. No competing raw owner or wrapper exception IRQ. Write firewall allows only PMIC interrupt mask/status, power-key IRQ selection, backlight PWM duty/enables. Rail, charger, current and reset-policy writes fail `-EPERM`; regulators have no voltage constraints/consumers. |
| I2C/input | Native I2C0 and empty I2C1 with AP-DMA; wheel register-zero + repeated-start nine-byte frames. Navigation, wheel, volume keypad and upstream PMIC power key produce evdev. PID1 discovers all four names, verifies opened names, captures initial held keys and press/release events, including deferred devices. |
| DRM/panel | Separate MT6582 OVL format, RDMA FIFO, COLOR/mutex/MMSYS variants; existing 6.18 OVL pitch fix retained. 480×360 GC9503V candidate with LK command table, RGB888 two-lane sync-pulse link and MMSYS reset routed through GPIO112. Linux allocates the framebuffer in D08; old raw framebuffer/devmem mechanisms are absent. Standard fbcon replaces the diagnostic screen. |
| PHY/DSI/backlight | Actual 338MHz PLL contract for the donor's programmed PCW, evidence-based cold enable order, no PLL_TOP reads or unnecessary access after lane shutdown. Park inherited stream before OVL takeover; balanced probe references; bound a stuck DSI hard IRQ and mask it on timeout. Backlight holds inherited current/clock settings, uses monotonic PWM up to the lowest inherited duty, propagates errors and attempts rollback while dark. Cold/unrecognized ISINK setup fails probe safely. |
| microSD/eMMC | Upstream MSDC variant, inherited-DMA-idle guard and documented 26MHz crystal source; one-bit bus, card rate capped at 400kHz. No `MMC_BLOCK`, disk mount, filesystem, write/erase/vendor command or eMMC CMD6. CID/CSD responses are logged. eMMC may intentionally fail initialization at its first configuration switch; identity before that is useful. SD identification/SCR is useful, not a throughput/rootfs qualification. |
| Basic power | Standard read-only `y2-usb-presence` power_supply ONLINE from previously evidenced CHRDET bit5; regulator summary uses upstream selector/voltage tables. No invented battery percentage, ADC voltage, temperature, charge-current or charging-state claim. |

## RAM reconciliation and DMA boundary

**D08 retained: 24MiB at `80000000–81800000`, plus 512KiB at
`84000000–84080000`; low `80000000–80004000` remains reserved.**

| Evidence | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| Own D08 boot, photographed 22,208kB MemTotal, stock `/proc/iomem` | D08 works; stock main RAM and donor agree on `80000000–be000000` (992MiB). Stock capacity alone does not transfer LK/runtime ownership to this kernel. |
| LK code/BSS at `81e00000–81e55434`, heap upper/live extent unbounded | Cannot exclude only the BSS and assume every higher page is free. Do not invent a small extra interval or declare all 992MiB available. |
| Modem `be000000–bf800000`, stock extra bank `bf800000–bfa00000`, inferred connectivity `bfa00000–bfb00000`, framebuffer `bfb00000–c0000000` and diagnostic scratch near `bf700000` | Keep all outside managed RAM. Donor consys reservation near `bdf00000` is not adopted. Display takeover does not establish that every loader/DMA reservation is reclaimable. |
| Actual 6.18 non-LPAE, PAGE_OFFSET `c0000000`, HIGHMEM=n | `mmu.c` defaults to 240MiB vmalloc + 8MiB guard: physical lowmem ceiling `b0000000` (768MiB), before reservations. Full donor RAM would additionally require a reviewed HIGHMEM/address-space change; a 992MiB DT is not 992MiB usable lowmem. |

**Single ownership blocker for useful expansion:** a defensible upper/live
boundary for LK heap and inherited DMA outside D08. Address-space/HIGHMEM work
is a separate calculable design choice once ownership is known. No capacity
claim from their unit supplies that missing ownership evidence on ours.

Current kernel Image **4,878,848 B**, BSS **312,720 B**, resident span
**5,191,568 B**; PID1 ELF **816,160 B**, gzip initramfs **13,399 B**. The retained
[layout](results/m2-baseline-01-layout.json) checks the actual relocated compressed
copy, tables, stack, inflated image/BSS, DT/initrd, LK read tail and 16MiB BOOTIMG
limit. Driver DMA uses Linux allocations within D08; no LK framebuffer pointer
is given to Linux's allocator. Runtime memory pressure/fragmentation remains a
hardware observation, not an offline guarantee.

## Validation and remaining risks

One clean kernel build tree, with compiler/API errors repaired there; no second
reproducibility build. Final compiled units and DT have no outstanding warnings
or errors. Configuration dependencies and actual linked subsystems were checked.
**24 applicable test methods pass:** provider arithmetic/write filters, actual
PWRAP callback faults, host/ARM multiple-device evdev and relay/backpressure,
USB lifecycle/failure guards and linked syscalls, corrupt real artifacts, and
host capture/reconnect fixtures. The ARM PID1 selftest also passes. Superseded
single-device/screen fixtures are historical, not claimed as baseline tests.

The review caught and fixed a retained-history/queue capacity mismatch that
would lose replay after a long first capture. Replay history is 256KiB and the
queue 512KiB; kernel ring 256KiB. `GAP`/`ERR` and snapshot truncation are explicit;
any such marker prevents claiming a complete log. Standard snapshots include
CPU/online set, memory/zones/buddy/iomem, IRQs, clocks, deferred probes, regulator
summary, power-supply uevent and input devices. No ROM/source-tree rehash,
SPFT/recovery rediscovery, device access or flashing was performed.

New drivers, SMP and the changed provider/USB integration are **not hardware
qualified**. MM/PWM source rates, cold power-domain ownership, inherited keypad/
eMMC pads, panel identity/revision, I2C/EINT wiring, low-speed card compatibility,
DRM timing/IRQ behavior and longer-duration stability remain risks. Safe probe
failure is useful evidence. Failure before PID1/ACM can still prevent USB logs;
no independent early crash channel is claimed.

Intentionally disabled: charging policy/experiments, battery ADC/gauge/thermal
without justified units, cpufreq/cpuidle/suspend, production shutdown/watchdog,
all disk writes/mounts/rootfs installation, audio/DAC/amplifier activation,
Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/FM, Mali/userspace GPU and applications. I2C1 has no M3 clients.
This older unit has no usable FM reception hardware.

To reproduce later in a fresh output directory (no duplicate build was run):

```sh
python3 tools/build/run.py --output out/m2-baseline-next -- sh /project/tools/build/baseline.sh
```

Existing issues #22–#28 now carry this offline integration checkpoint and remain
open. Exact sources, resolved config, ELFs, logs and `SHA256SUMS` are retained
under `out/m2-baseline-01/`; `source/` and `source-sha256.json` retain the inputs.

## Exact owner flash and single-boot test

1. Use the already working SPFT **v5.2032** setup and original
   `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Player/y2_v3.2.0_FM-20260813/MT6582_Android_scatter.txt`.
   Select **Download Only**, deselect every row, then select **BOOTIMG only** and
   choose the image above. Check its size/hash. Let the scatter resolve the
   address; no raw Write Memory, format, upgrade, loader or calibration operation.
2. Flash manually using the same successful power/cable sequence. Close/stop
   SPFT's operation, unplug USB and start the host capture command below before
   normal power-on through stock LK. Start an independent **300-second timer
   at power-on**. This supersedes 60 seconds only for this candidate: AP watchdog
   stop and BOOTIMG recovery are proven; it permits idle observation, not stress.
3. Insert an ordinary test microSD before boot if available; no formatting or
   rootfs is needed. Boot **unplugged**, wait **10 seconds**, attach the data
   cable. The old `ATTACH USB` diagnostic screen no longer exists. If no ACM/log
   appears within 30 seconds after attachment, retain the failure/screen and
   terminate this trial using the known recovery route; do not leave it running.
4. During the initial **180-second capture**, press/release Prev, Menu, Next,
   Play and Select separately, then rotate the wheel slowly both directions and
   press/release Volume−, Volume+, and **briefly** Power. Use approximately
   half-second presses with gaps; no long Power hold as an input test. Expected
   navigation codes 105/158/106/164/28; volume 114/115, power116; wheel may produce
   up/down/page events. Observe display geometry, colors, readable console,
   flicker, illumination and ordinary warmth. Do not stress CPU or test charging.
5. Optional, if logging is healthy and at least 80 seconds remain: after the
   first command exits, unplug once, start the second capture command, and
   reconnect after five unplugged seconds. Capture for 60 seconds. Only one
   reconnect is supported; it must not reset the device deadline or heartbeat.
6. End sooner on abnormal warmth, reset loops or lost observation. End the
   hardware run **by 300 seconds from power-on**, using the owner's known power/
   recovery sequence; restore **BOOTIMG only** through the same Download Only
   procedure. The last recorded working Android restore is
   `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Player/out/boot-adb/boot.img`, 5,875,712 B,
   SHA-256 `275870974bbecc74233761753187ee478bfe79ca9d2f2818facd6e0c039c6b43`;
   see [actual recovery](../knowledge/first-experiment-result.md). Keep that
   established setup ready; do not substitute a full-ROM restore.

Run on the **real host** from `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux`:

```sh
sudo python3 tools/observation/usb_log_capture.py --build M2-BASELINE-01 \
  --seconds 180 --output out/m2-baseline-01/capture-01
```

Optional second capture, started while unplugged:

```sh
sudo python3 tools/observation/usb_log_capture.py --build M2-BASELINE-01 \
  --wait-seconds 30 --seconds 60 --output out/m2-baseline-01/capture-02
```

The tool discovers and verifies the actual ACM device, asserts DTR and sends
LOG1; it does not assume ttyACM0. Keep **both complete directories** (`raw.bin`,
USB descriptors, hashes, timestamps, exit report), including failures. Exit0 is
collection success, not platform qualification. Report power-on/cable timing,
physical button order, display behavior and Android restoration. Then review all
probe/runtime failures together, fix independent issues in one source iteration,
and build one next candidate. **Stop here for the owner's manual flash.**
