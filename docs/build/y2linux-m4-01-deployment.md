# Y2LINUX-M4-01 — integrated power candidate, manual deployment pending

This BOOTIMG retains the physically accepted Storage06 internal boot layout:
Y2ROOT on eMMC p5, Y2DATA on p7, existing SSH identity and Buildroot userspace.
No rootfs/data update is required. An SD card is optional. This is an M4 test
candidate, not completed hardware qualification.

The [architecture and source reconciliation](../knowledge/m4-power-platform.md)
records the live baseline, exact register/units/calibration assumptions, vendor
references and limitations. The [activation audit](../planning/roadmap-gap-audit.md)
keeps every physical acceptance gate open. M3's period-notification startup
correction, commit137b3f2, is retained.

## Implemented interfaces

| Area | Candidate behavior |
| --- | --- |
| PMIC | One serialized MT6582 PWRAP → regmap → MT6323 MFD; regulator/key/RTC/poweroff plus ADC/charger/backlight children |
| Battery | `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/`: present, status, health, voltage_now; configured constant_charge_current/voltage are read-only limits, not measured current |
| USB | `/sys/class/power_supply/y2-usb-presence/online`, CHRDET event and polling |
| Charging | Inhibited. No validated pack thermometry/profile/input policy. Inherited current/CV retained; live baseline70mA/4.175V. No capacity, current_now, battery temp or claimed full-charge detection |
| Thermal | `thermal_zone*/type` = cpu-thermal and pmic-thermal; calibrated temperatures in m°C only with valid own efuses; otherwise unavailable. CPU passive110°C/critical120°C, PMIC critical150°C from BSP |
| CPU frequency | One policy0 for CPUs0–3:598000/747500/1040000kHz, all1.15V; default powersave; no VPROC write or overclock |
| Idle / suspend | Architectural WFI only; `mem` selects s2idle, `freeze` also available. No SPM/deep/DRAM power-down; retained eMMC controller/card state |
| Wake | Brief Power key; RTC alarm if valid/armed. USB, wheel and volume are not selected wake sources |
| Display / audio | DRM/panel/backlight PM, ordered ASoC/codec/AFE PM. VGP2 retained1.8V. Physical repeat playback and resume tests still required |
| RTC | `/dev/rtc0`, standard read/set/alarm APIs; no automatic system/RTC time writes and no RTC spare/boot-state writes |
| Reboot / off | Upstream MediaTek AP watchdog software reset for reboot; MT6323 RTC BBPU/WRTGR power controller for actual poweroff. Charger watchdog is separate and untouched |

Battery voltage uses the MT6323 15-bit1.8V ADC with hardware4:1 divider and
inherited factory trim. There is no claim of independently measured absolute
accuracy or external power consumption. PMIC die temperature is not pack
temperature. The charger watchdog needs servicing for a future active charging
policy; an inhibited charge engine requires no pet/re-enable loop.

## Build and package

The final build receipt records the exact source commit, bytes and hashes.
The reproducible commands, run from the repository root with reviewed clean Git:

```sh
python3 tools/production/build.py --output out/y2linux-m4-01-build --reuse-userspace out/y2linux-production-v1-r4
python3 tools/production/boot_update.py --build out/y2linux-m4-01-build --base out/y2linux-production-v1-r4 --fallback-package out/y2linux-production-v1-r6 --output out/y2linux-m4-01
```

The package contains `BOOTIMG.img`, `MT6582_BOOTIMG_only_scatter.txt`, manifest,
hashes, and `fallback/BOOTIMG-previous.img`. The fallback is the working
Storage06 BOOTIMG, SHA256
`3ba809e44bd9c945c994209d1d93f41fe0da9259a303487dd6ecf49724bf49a8`,
5193728bytes. The prior Storage04 rescue image is not the selected fallback.

## Owner's exact manual deployment

1. In `out/y2linux-m4-01`, verify `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`.
2. Use the established SPFT/DA procedure, **Download Only**. Load
   `MT6582_BOOTIMG_only_scatter.txt` from that directory.
3. Select **BOOTIMG → BOOTIMG.img only**. All other rows remain unchecked,
   including PRELOADER, LK/UBOOT, MBR/EBR, ANDROID, USRDATA and NVRAM.
   Do not select Format or Firmware Upgrade.
4. Perform the manual BOOTIMG flash and boot normally. Preserve existing
   Y2ROOT/Y2DATA; no SD image and no rootfs installation are involved.
5. Keep USB connected for the main qualification. If the candidate cannot boot,
   use the same BOOTIMG-only selection with `fallback/BOOTIMG-previous.img`.

The agent stops before deployment. The commands below are for the one physical
qualification after the owner reports deployment; they have not been run on
the current Storage06 kernel.

## Exact SSH qualification sequence

Host terminal, from the repository root:

```sh
y2ssh() { ssh -T -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=yes -i "$HOME/.ssh/y2linux_ed25519" root@10.42.0.1 "$@"; }
y2ssh 'cat > /tmp/qualify-m4.sh' < tools/development/qualify-m4.sh
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh begin'
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh audio'
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh rtc'
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh dvfs'
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh idle'
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh display'
```

`begin` records boot ID, four CPUs/RAM, exact internal mounts, power/thermal/
clock/regulator state, IRQs and logs in `/data/y2linux-m4-01/`. It writes a256KiB
ordinary-file integrity sentinel in Y2DATA; no raw storage or mounted-fs fsck.
`audio` repeats the proven44.1kHz stereo fixture at the existing -24dB mixer
setting, with output disabled between plays. Observe clean audible output twice.
`dvfs` refuses load unless both calibrated die zones work and remain below60°C
and battery voltage is at least3.4V. These are conservative test-stop thresholds,
not asserted battery/SoC protection limits. Each transition runs at most5seconds
of four CPU loops, checks temperature each second, and restores powersave on
exit. Failure is an acceptance result, not permission to bypass a guard.

Inspect `/proc/bus/input/devices` from the record. Test each identified event
node with `y2ssh 'timeout 15 evtest /dev/input/eventN'`, replacing N with the
actual Power/navigation/volume/wheel node. Press briefly; do not test emergency
long-press shutdown. Observe display/backlight off/on and restored framebuffer
without a black-screen or DRM warning.

Keep USB connected. First suspend uses the Power key alone:

```sh
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh suspend'
# Wait about 10 seconds with the display dark, then briefly press Power.
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh post-resume'
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh audio'
```

The original SSH command should return after wake. Boot ID must stay identical;
sentinel hash and both ext4 mounts must survive. Inspect PM wake IRQ, dmesg,
USB, input and display. An early wake without the intended Power event is a
failure to investigate. A USB session failure alone is not proof of reboot;
CDC ACM diagnostics and the persistent logs can distinguish it. Do not repeatedly
hard-reset a mounted rootfs. No alarm is silently installed as a rescue for the
Power test because that would obscure its wake-source result.

RTC is read-first. If time is valid and no alarm was already configured:

```sh
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh rtc-alarm'
```

It programs only a15second alarm through the RTC API and tests a second s2idle
entry. Do not press Power during this test. If the RTC was uninitialized, first
record its original state, then deliberately set time using the host's UTC epoch
and the normal API (no raw RTC/PMIC write):

```sh
y2_epoch=$(date -u +%s)
y2ssh "date -u -s @$y2_epoch; hwclock -w -u; hwclock -r -u"
```

Retain an existing alarm; do not clear it just to run the test. Record RTC again
after the following reboot to assess persistence. No automatic boot-time write
is installed.

Test a single cable cycle at the end, since the separately deferred USB
reconnect issue can lose SSH. This explicitly schedules an orderly reboot
after40seconds so the recorded observations can be recovered:

```sh
y2ssh 'nohup sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh cable-reboot > /data/y2linux-m4-01/cable.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &'
# Disconnect after about 5 seconds, leave disconnected 10 seconds, reconnect.
# Wait for the scheduled reboot and normal USB enumeration.
y2ssh 'cat > /tmp/qualify-m4.sh' < tools/development/qualify-m4.sh
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh post-reboot'
y2ssh 'cat /data/y2linux-m4-01/cable.log; sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh rtc'
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh audio'
```

The log should show USB ONLINE1→0→1 with STATUS Not charging→Discharging→Not
charging. No battery charge-current measurement or charge completion is claimed.
If skipping the cable test, use `y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh reboot'` instead,
then reload the `/tmp` script and run `post-reboot`. Verify the new boot ID,
internal root/data, retained file hash, RTC, display, input and audio.

Finally test real hardware-off with USB disconnected to distinguish charger
insertion/auto-boot behavior from failure to remove power:

```sh
y2ssh 'nohup sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh poweroff > /data/y2linux-m4-01/poweroff.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &'
# Disconnect USB during the 15-second delay. Observe actual hardware-off.
# Briefly press Power for normal power-on, reconnect USB, then:
y2ssh 'cat > /tmp/qualify-m4.sh' < tools/development/qualify-m4.sh
y2ssh 'sh /tmp/qualify-m4.sh post-reboot'
```

A halted kernel or dark display alone does not prove hardware-off. Record the
physical outcome and subsequent normal power-on. No external current draw is
invented. Retrieve the software records with:

```sh
y2ssh 'tar -C /data -czf - y2linux-m4-01' > out/y2linux-m4-01-physical.tgz
```

The owner must observe: normal visible boot, clean audio before/after idle and
resume, working controls, backlight/panel off/on, sustained suspend followed by
the intended wake, safe cable behavior, normal reboot, actual poweroff and
subsequent power-on. Missing calibration, charging inhibit, shallow retention
and any failed hardware test remain explicit M4 limitations; driver probe alone
does not close the milestone.
