# Production Storage v1 — Storage03 manual correction candidate

All three payloads are rebuilt/generated and validated offline. Physical boot,
USB enumeration and power-entry correction are NOT established. The owner cannot
provide further device data; no additional evidence request is required to build
this candidate. [Correction rationale](../knowledge/storage03-corrections.md).

Storage03 corrects cable-present USB startup with checked MT6582 PHY recovery,
handles bounded MMC transfers and idempotent user-area reselection, avoids boot
partition probing and makes rescue readable without SD. The exact rejected
command in DIAG01 remains unknown because the photo truncates it. The reported
off-state button/power behaviour has no proven cause or verified fix; stock
loaders, PMIC power entry and battery controls remain unchanged.

Use the new Storage03 folder. BOOTIMG and Y2ROOT must match because the root
contains its DRM module. Y2DATA remains schema 1 and is compatible with Storage02:
the generated template is for explicit fresh initialization, not a required
persistent-data reset. Use the preserve-data profile to retain existing Y2DATA.
No assistant physical write or SPFT execution occurred.

1. **Build Git commit:** `48458605db5f53bd188921d53359e470f1e8bf05`.
   Canonical project SchulzCode/Y2Linux; existing Luca/SchulzCode identity retained.
   Later evidence-only commits do not change these built bytes.
2. **Exact stock map** and 3. **classification of every entry** follow. All normal
   starts are physical EMMC_USER bytes; the full machine-readable map includes
   distinct scatter linear values, stock runtime mappings and provenance.

PRELOADER is EMMC_BOOT_1: the scatter's20MiB span is a vendor abstraction,
**not** a physical readback length; each boot hardware region is4MiB. BMTPOOL's
sentinels remain UNKNOWN/unapproved. FAT's zero scatter span resolves physically
to0x15dc00000 bytes and may contain user media; leave it alone. EMMC_USER capacity
historically exported by Android is 7,784,103,936 bytes (0x1cff80000).
DA reports physical capacity 7,818,182,656 bytes (0x1d2000000). The unallocated
difference remains untouched; DIAG01 physically confirms the same 15269888-sector native Linux capacity.
Preserve MBR/EBR1/EBR2; no repartitioning occurs.

11. **BOOTIMG**, 12. **scatter**, 13. **manifest**, and filesystem transports:

All files below are in `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-production-v1-r3/`.

The scatter maps **Y2ROOT.img and Y2DATA.img directly** as raw ext4; there are
no .spft.img payloads in this package. The transfers are 512 MiB and 800 MiB,
respectively, and take longer than the failed compressed transport. Every
written image byte has a defined hash. BOOTIMG is raw at physical 0x01d80000
within its 16 MiB span. The first scatter selects BOOTIMG/ANDROID/USRDATA;
the preserving profile selects BOOTIMG/ANDROID only.

14. **Restoration material for every overwritten partition:** verified original
    FM sources below exist locally in
    `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Player/y2_v3.2.0_FM-20260813/`.
    They restore factory Android, not personalized installed Android state.
    Preserve a private USRDATA readback before install if original settings/apps
    must be recoverable; likewise ANDROID if its modifications matter. Keep an
    independent accessible copy of recovery material. No full-ROM rebackup needed.

| Overwritten partition | Verified stock source | Bytes | SHA256 |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| BOOTIMG | boot.img | 5656576 | `5ef1bdf28481ee0bf5f3528c1ddd91cf3f4d2d5f39e4d0ea049a8137a30f6af6` |

15. **SPFT boxes to select:** BOOTIMG→BOOTIMG.img,
    ANDROID→Y2ROOT.img, USRDATA→Y2DATA.img only for explicit fresh initialization; USRDATA erases existing persistent data.
    For preserving retry select BOOTIMG and ANDROID using the preserve-data scatter.
16. **Boxes NEVER selected in this installation:** PRELOADER, MBR, EBR1,
    PRO_INFO, NVRAM, PROTECT_F, PROTECT_S, SECCFG, UBOOT/LK, RECOVERY, SEC_RO,
    MISC, LOGO, EBR2, EXPDB, CACHE, FAT, BMTPOOL.
17. **Download Only procedure:** use owner-proven SPFTv5.2032 and its DA, verify
    package checksums, retain before readbacks/table identity, load the package's
    first-install scatter, review all21 rows, select exactly the3 above, choose
    Download Only, and use the established owner USB/power entry sequence.
    No Format All + Download, Firmware Upgrade, Write Memory, table changes or
    workaround if SPFT reports an identity/table/image error. Remove SD before
    first normal production boot. [Exact install procedure](../architecture/production-install.md).
18. **Readback/verification:** before the write capture the13 bounded EMMC_USER
    KEEP ranges in metadata/readback-plan.json. The verifier checks original
    MBR/EBR prefixes with `--before-only`; after download recapture these ranges
    plus full BOOTIMG16MiB, ANDROID820MiB and USRDATA800MiB, **before boot**.
    Compare protected ranges exactly and target raw-image prefixes by SHA256:

```
python3 tools/production/verify_readback.py --package out/y2linux-production-v1-r3 --before /path/to/before --before-only
python3 tools/production/verify_readback.py --package out/y2linux-production-v1-r3 --before /path/to/before --after /path/to/after
```

If pre-failure captures exist, retain and compare those too. Captures taken only
after the failed attempt establish preservation across the retry; they cannot
prove the earlier attempt left every protected byte unchanged.

Physical starts are BOOTIMG0x1d80000, ANDROID0x5180000, USRDATA0x40380000;
scatter linear starts are0x3180000,0x6580000,0x41780000. SPFT normal Download
uses its original scatter mapping; EMMC_USER Readback uses physical offsets.
Linux whole-disk offsets are those same physical values, while a partition node
starts at offset0. No custom DA/global offsets are guessed. Preserve logs proving
which device/DA/region was read; file hashes alone cannot establish that.

19. **Expected first boot:** stock ROM→preloader→LK→Linux6.18.0-y2linux-storage03
    rescue→internal Y2ROOT/Y2DATA→switch_root→Buildroot. Discovery allows40s.
20. **Expected no-SD boot:** identical boot path; removable SD is ignored by the
    root resolver. Later SD serves media through explicit `y2-media mount`;
    nothing autoformats it. Old SD root labels cannot hijack production boot.
21. **Expected SSH/USB:** cable-present or later-attached startup is now supported in code;
    initial ACM diagnostics and usb0 at10.42.0.1/24 are expected,
    key-only SSH after normal Buildroot boot. New per-owner client private key
    lives OUTSIDE the package at
    `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-production-private/id_ed25519`.
    Keep it private and backed up separately. Only its new public key is inside
    Y2DATA. Dropbear generates new host keys on-device and persists them on /data.
    First key generation can wait for kernel entropy; historical delay was~154s.
    Use a separate host alias for the new production identity:

```
ssh -F /dev/null -o HostKeyAlias=y2linux-production-v1 -i /home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-production-private/id_ed25519 root@10.42.0.1
```

Verify the new host key. No development private key or universal production
credential is packaged. USB cable reconnect remains a known deferred limitation.

22. **Rescue failure behavior:** missing/ambiguous/wrong label/UUID/geometry,
    root/data marker failure, failed executable preflight, unrepairable fsck or
    mount failure retains rescue PID1, readable on-screen status and ACM logging intent. No automatic format,
    SD fallback or reboot loop. There is no rescue SSH service. Stock UART/console
    shell remains where usable; ACM keeps one log writer. Final handover crashes
    and pre-gadget faults are outside this fallback's guarantee. A torn BOOTIMG
    can require SPFT because its own rescue may no longer load.
23. **Exact restoration:** quickest Linux fallback: original scatter,
    Download Only, deselect all, BOOTIMG only→the preserved AUDIO-02 image
    (4816896bytes, SHA256b9dbf6b528e4afbee2a5ffb2fc65df7f6a076564e92960332e24cee3809b5842),
    verify readback prefix, insert original SD and boot. It disables eMMC and
    leaves new internal root/data intact. Factory Android restoration instead
    selects ONLY BOOTIMG→FM boot.img, ANDROID→FM system.img,
    USRDATA→FM userdata.img; it destroys Y2DATA. Never restore loaders/tables/
    calibration as part of either route. [Full restoration/readback procedure](../architecture/production-recovery.md).
24. **Future OTA support:** independent kernel/root/app versions and hashes,
    stable layout1 geometry, explicit component/partition allowlists and ABI/schema
    requirements. BOOTIMG-only updates must supply/validate matching DRM modules;
    Y2ROOT image replacement preserves /data. Future app bundles can live under
    /data/apps/y2player/releases with atomic activation and /data/y2player state,
    alongside a future built-in Buildroot package. No app partition or app/updater
    code is implemented. Staged rescue updates are preferred to forced A/B;
    interrupted BOOTIMG uses external SPFT recovery. No repartition is needed for
    this direction. [Update/installer contract](../architecture/update-model.md).

## Validation and remaining physical boundary

PASS 33 regression tests plus a separate linked-kernel USB test, emitted kernel/DT/D08 memory/BOOTIMG checks, matching
DRM module, ARM ABI and ALSA utilities, rescue shell syntax, ext4 e2fsck checks,
label/UUID, root/data contents and ownership, raw ext4 transport identity,
all21 stock scatter coordinates/no overlap, allowlists, versions and package
hash inventory. The retained readback verifier still requires owner captures. No physical
readbacks or protected-data preservation result are asserted for this candidate.

Production Storage v1/#33/milestone3 remains ACTIVE. M3's44.1kHz result stands,
48kHz/LR/repeat remain pending. No-SD boot, native internal MMC filesystems,
writability/persistence, display/input/audio retention, protected-byte readbacks
and rescue-negative behavior must be physically demonstrated. Expected RAM is
comparable to live AUDIO-02's954384KiB, with four CPUs; record the actual new value.
Do not close the milestone from SPFT completion. M4/M5 remain unstarted and
Y2PlayerNative remains deferred. **STOP here for the owner's manual operation.**
