# M2-BASELINE-03 — keep the log reader ahead of display probing

**Owner-tested: logging responds through display initialization; screen remains
black.** M1 COMPLETE, M2 ACTIVE. The 180-second capture-02 contains all kernel
records0–605 and PID1 through heartbeat184. DRM/fb0/module initialization returns
success; wheel I2C reads time out. See the
[physical result](../knowledge/m2-baseline-hardware-result.md#latest-baseline-03-logs-the-display-handoff-screen-remains-black).
The artifact and original handoff procedure below are retained unchanged.

BASELINE-02 enumerated over USB but its 180-second capture contained zero bytes.
The owner saw black/grey after LK. [Evidence](../knowledge/m2-baseline-hardware-result.md)
does not identify the failed instruction or establish PID1 responsiveness.

**Image:** `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/m2-baseline-03/BOOTIMG.img`  
**Size:** 2,129,920 bytes  
**SHA-256:** `dae729341fd52d3abe16899ec332b2fdacd2a0fcbde15e796d496a0c443fa543`  
**Identity:** Linux `6.18.0-y2-m2-baseline3`; LOG1 `M2-BASELINE-03`.

## What changed and why

MediaTek DRM is the **sole loadable module**, packaged as `/display.ko` in the
RAM-only initramfs. Its dependencies and all other baseline core drivers remain
built in. PID1 starts first, completes its initial provider snapshots and accepts
LOG1. After heartbeat12 and successful relay output, it starts one separate child
through ordinary clone/finit_module calls. PID1 stays on CPU0; the child loads on
previously observed CPU1. Parent checks child completion with wait4(WNOHANG),
logs pending status every 15 seconds and never waits synchronously for module
initialization. No retry, unload, shell or external module discovery. A session
starting at heartbeat240 or later skips display loading to respect the test window.

This isolates synchronous driver-probe waits from the existing logging process;
it cannot guarantee survival of a global bus fault or shared-kernel lockup.
The child log records module start/result, and DSI records PHY acquisition,
parking, release, host registration and command-engine initialization. LOG1 and
kernel/PID1 relay use the original single USB writer and transport. No new USB
console or endpoint changes. Module loading starts automatically within this one
baseline test; it does not require a separate controller/register flash.

Also fixed a source-level safety gap: MT6582 panel transfers now return
`-EHOSTDOWN` before touching DSI MMIO if pre-enable/power-on failed. The existing
6.18 host-before-panel bridge ordering is already correct and was not re-ported.
Panel initialization values, live/cold PHY sequence and timing remain as in
BASELINE-02; this candidate does **not** claim to have diagnosed/fixed the actual
black-screen cause without a kernel log.

The [packaging/startup review](../planning/roadmap-gap-audit.md#baseline-03-observation-and-packaging-review--2026-09-10)
retains D08, SMP/GPT/watchdog policy, CCF/pinctrl/EINT/PWRAP/PMIC, input, MMC
identity/read-only enforcement and USB reconnect/deadline. Disk writes/mounts,
charger/rail/current policy, audio, radios/FM, GPU/apps and production PM remain
excluded. No original loader, partition layout, calibration or donor source changed.

## Validation and retained artifacts

One clean kernel build tree; hidden DRM dependency selections and a diagnostic
placement compiler error were corrected there. Final kernel/module have no
compiler warnings/errors or unresolved modpost symbols. Exactly one modules.order
entry; ARM32 relocatable ABI, build vermagic and empty external module dependencies
checked. The exact module bytes must match the initramfs; foreign/extra module
entries and changed payloads fail validation. All loader syscall table entries
are real linked implementations, including clone, wait4, affinity and finit_module.

**28 applicable test methods pass:** shared provider/PHY guards, host and ARM
input/relay/loader faults, USB lifecycle/capture, exact module archive/caps and
mutated real artifacts. The final loader-order refinement prevents clock/regulator
snapshots from racing a stuck display clock operation; only PID1/initramfs/DT and
BOOTIMG were repackaged, with affected loader/artifact tests rerun. The kernel was
not rebuilt for that refinement. ARM PID1 selftest passes. Intermediate package
is retained under `out/m2-baseline-03/intermediate/`, not the flash candidate.

D08 map unchanged. Kernel Image 5,017,024B; BSS310,856B; resident span5,327,880B.
PID1 817,800B plus module154,460B = **972,260B** regular-file payload, within the
existing 2MiB cap; compressed initramfs62,733B fits its 512KiB bank. Full emitted
layout/relocation/package validation passes. Runtime module allocation/COW and
working-set headroom still require observation; no arbitrary RAM expansion.
[Layout](results/m2-baseline-03-layout.json), [test/package manifest](results/m2-baseline-03-iteration.json),
ELFs/config/module/logs and source snapshots with SHA256SUMS are retained under
`out/m2-baseline-03/`. No repeated ROM/source-tree/recovery audit or reproducibility build.

## Owner flash and one-boot test

1. Existing SPFT **v5.2032**, original
   `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Player/y2_v3.2.0_FM-20260813/MT6582_Android_scatter.txt`:
   **Download Only**, every row unchecked except **BOOTIMG**, image/hash above.
   Use the established owner flash/power sequence; no format, upgrade or other row.
2. Stop SPFT and unplug. Start capture below before normal power-on. Keep the
   test microSD inserted. Start an independent **300-second timer at power-on**;
   boot unplugged and attach after **10 seconds**. LK logo initially remaining
   is now expected: display probing starts only after the log reader is active.
3. Capture for 180 seconds. Observe the screen transition after USB starts,
   test navigation and volume, briefly press Power, and slide a finger around
   the capacitive wheel both directions. Record physical action order. A later
   black/grey screen is not display success; keep recording if logging is healthy.
   If no response arrives within 30 seconds after attachment, or logging stops
   unexpectedly, end via the known recovery route rather than waiting blindly.
4. Optional single reconnect only with at least 80 seconds left: unplug, start
   the second command, reconnect after five unplugged seconds. The display module
   must not be loaded a second time. No timer restart or second detach experiment.
5. End on abnormal warmth/faults or **by 300 seconds from power-on**. USB cutoff
   around295s does not power off the unit. Use established owner power/recovery
   steps and restore **BOOTIMG only** from
   `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Player/out/boot-adb/boot.img`. Report restoration.

```sh
cd /home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux
sudo python3 tools/observation/usb_log_capture.py --build M2-BASELINE-03 \
  --seconds 180 --output out/m2-baseline-03/capture-01
```

Optional reconnect, command started while unplugged:

```sh
sudo python3 tools/observation/usb_log_capture.py --build M2-BASELINE-03 \
  --wait-seconds 30 --seconds 60 --output out/m2-baseline-03/capture-02
```

No automatic hardware qualification from exit0; retain complete capture directories.
A zero-byte/exit2 result is failed observation even when enumeration succeeds.
**Stop for the owner's manual flash; no physical device was written by the agent.**
