# Production Storage v1 — Storage02 manual retry

**Ready for the owner's manual retry; physical qualification remains pending.**
The first package failed because its sparse FILL chunks are rejected by the
selected MT6582 Download Agent. BOOTIMG transfer/checksum completed; ANDROID
failed and may be partially written; USRDATA was not reached. This does not prove
an eMMC hardware fault or unchanged protected data. See the retained
[failure analysis and actual DA parser](../hardware-evidence/2026-09-13-storage-flash-failure/README.md).

Use only the new folder below. It maps raw ext4 images directly, avoiding the
unsupported sparse parser. Flash all three matching images, including the new
BOOTIMG: Storage02 also corrects the eMMC physical-capacity guard. No partition
boundary or runtime write allowlist was expanded. The original package remains
unchanged as evidence and must not be retried.

1. **Build Git commit:** `c2db4893b79eca25458b6adc318232c80dd99872`.
   Canonical project SchulzCode/Y2Linux; existing Luca/SchulzCode identity retained.
   Later evidence-only commits do not change these built bytes.
2. **Exact stock map** and 3. **classification of every entry** follow. All normal
   starts are physical EMMC_USER bytes; the full machine-readable map includes
   distinct scatter linear values, stock runtime mappings and provenance.

PRELOADER is EMMC_BOOT_1: the scatter's20MiB span is a vendor abstraction,
**not** a physical readback length; each boot hardware region is4MiB. BMTPOOL's
sentinels remain UNKNOWN/unapproved. FAT's zero scatter span resolves physically
to0x15dc00000 bytes and may contain user media; leave it alone. EMMC_USER capacity
historically exported by Android is 7,784,103,936 bytes (0x1cff80000).
DA reports physical capacity 7,818,182,656 bytes (0x1d2000000). The unallocated
difference remains untouched; the native Linux view awaits physical measurement.
Preserve MBR/EBR1/EBR2; no repartitioning occurs.

11. **BOOTIMG**, 12. **scatter**, 13. **manifest**, and filesystem transports:

All files below are in `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-production-v1-r2/`.

The scatter maps **Y2ROOT.img and Y2DATA.img directly** as raw ext4; there are
no .spft.img payloads in this package. The transfers are 512 MiB and 800 MiB,
respectively, and take longer than the failed compressed transport. Every
written image byte has a defined hash. BOOTIMG is raw at physical 0x01d80000
within its 16 MiB span. The first scatter selects BOOTIMG/ANDROID/USRDATA;
the preserving profile selects BOOTIMG/ANDROID only.

14. **Restoration material for every overwritten partition:** verified original
    FM sources below exist locally in
    `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Player/y2_v3.2.0_FM-20260813/`.
    They restore factory Android, not personalized installed Android state.
    Preserve a private USRDATA readback before install if original settings/apps
    must be recoverable; likewise ANDROID if its modifications matter. Keep an
    independent accessible copy of recovery material. No full-ROM rebackup needed.

| Overwritten partition | Verified stock source | Bytes | SHA256 |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| BOOTIMG | boot.img | 5656576 | `5ef1bdf28481ee0bf5f3528c1ddd91cf3f4d2d5f39e4d0ea049a8137a30f6af6` |

15. **SPFT boxes to select:** BOOTIMG→BOOTIMG.img,
    ANDROID→Y2ROOT.img, USRDATA→Y2DATA.img for FIRST installation only.
16. **Boxes NEVER selected in this installation:** PRELOADER, MBR, EBR1,
    PRO_INFO, NVRAM, PROTECT_F, PROTECT_S, SECCFG, UBOOT/LK, RECOVERY, SEC_RO,
    MISC, LOGO, EBR2, EXPDB, CACHE, FAT, BMTPOOL.
17. **Download Only procedure:** use owner-proven SPFTv5.2032 and its DA, verify
    package checksums, retain before readbacks/table identity, load the package's
    first-install scatter, review all21 rows, select exactly the3 above, choose
    Download Only, and use the established owner USB/power entry sequence.
    No Format All + Download, Firmware Upgrade, Write Memory, table changes or
    workaround if SPFT reports an identity/table/image error. Remove SD before
    first normal production boot. [Exact install procedure](../architecture/production-install.md).
18. **Readback/verification:** before the write capture the13 bounded EMMC_USER
    KEEP ranges in metadata/readback-plan.json. The verifier checks original
    MBR/EBR prefixes with `--before-only`; after download recapture these ranges
    plus full BOOTIMG16MiB, ANDROID820MiB and USRDATA800MiB, **before boot**.
    Compare protected ranges exactly and target raw-image prefixes by SHA256:

```
python3 tools/production/verify_readback.py --package out/y2linux-production-v1-r2 --before /path/to/before --before-only
python3 tools/production/verify_readback.py --package out/y2linux-production-v1-r2 --before /path/to/before --after /path/to/after
```

If pre-failure captures exist, retain and compare those too. Captures taken only
after the failed attempt establish preservation across the retry; they cannot
prove the earlier attempt left every protected byte unchanged.

Physical starts are BOOTIMG0x1d80000, ANDROID0x5180000, USRDATA0x40380000;
scatter linear starts are0x3180000,0x6580000,0x41780000. SPFT normal Download
uses its original scatter mapping; EMMC_USER Readback uses physical offsets.
Linux whole-disk offsets are those same physical values, while a partition node
starts at offset0. No custom DA/global offsets are guessed. Preserve logs proving
which device/DA/region was read; file hashes alone cannot establish that.

19. **Expected first boot:** stock ROM→preloader→LK→Linux6.18.0-y2linux-storage02
    rescue→internal Y2ROOT/Y2DATA→switch_root→Buildroot. Discovery allows40s.
20. **Expected no-SD boot:** identical boot path; removable SD is ignored by the
    root resolver. Later SD serves media through explicit `y2-media mount`;
    nothing autoformats it. Old SD root labels cannot hijack production boot.
21. **Expected SSH/USB:** initial ACM diagnostics and usb0 at10.42.0.1/24,
    key-only SSH after normal Buildroot boot. New per-owner client private key
    lives OUTSIDE the package at
    `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-production-private/id_ed25519`.
    Keep it private and backed up separately. Only its new public key is inside
    Y2DATA. Dropbear generates new host keys on-device and persists them on /data.
    First key generation can wait for kernel entropy; historical delay was~154s.
    Use a separate host alias for the new production identity:

```
ssh -F /dev/null -o HostKeyAlias=y2linux-production-v1 -i /home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-production-private/id_ed25519 root@10.42.0.1
```

Verify the new host key. No development private key or universal production
credential is packaged. USB cable reconnect remains a known deferred limitation.

22. **Rescue failure behavior:** missing/ambiguous/wrong label/UUID/geometry,
    root/data marker failure, failed executable preflight, unrepairable fsck or
    mount failure retains rescue PID1 and ACM diagnostics. No automatic format,
    SD fallback or reboot loop. There is no rescue SSH service. Stock UART/console
    shell remains where usable; ACM keeps one log writer. Final handover crashes
    and pre-gadget faults are outside this fallback's guarantee. A torn BOOTIMG
    can require SPFT because its own rescue may no longer load.
23. **Exact restoration:** quickest Linux fallback: original scatter,
    Download Only, deselect all, BOOTIMG only→the preserved AUDIO-02 image
    (4816896bytes, SHA256b9dbf6b528e4afbee2a5ffb2fc65df7f6a076564e92960332e24cee3809b5842),
    verify readback prefix, insert original SD and boot. It disables eMMC and
    leaves new internal root/data intact. Factory Android restoration instead
    selects ONLY BOOTIMG→FM boot.img, ANDROID→FM system.img,
    USRDATA→FM userdata.img; it destroys Y2DATA. Never restore loaders/tables/
    calibration as part of either route. [Full restoration/readback procedure](../architecture/production-recovery.md).
24. **Future OTA support:** independent kernel/root/app versions and hashes,
    stable layout1 geometry, explicit component/partition allowlists and ABI/schema
    requirements. BOOTIMG-only updates must supply/validate matching DRM modules;
    Y2ROOT image replacement preserves /data. Future app bundles can live under
    /data/apps/y2player/releases with atomic activation and /data/y2player state,
    alongside a future built-in Buildroot package. No app partition or app/updater
    code is implemented. Staged rescue updates are preferred to forced A/B;
    interrupted BOOTIMG uses external SPFT recovery. No repartition is needed for
    this direction. [Update/installer contract](../architecture/update-model.md).

## Validation and remaining physical boundary

PASS 26 regression tests, emitted kernel/DT/D08 memory/BOOTIMG checks, matching
DRM module, ARM ABI and ALSA utilities, rescue shell syntax, ext4 e2fsck checks,
label/UUID, root/data contents and ownership, raw ext4 transport identity,
all21 stock scatter coordinates/no overlap, allowlists, versions and package
hash inventory. Synthetic readback tests reject both root-image corruption and
protected-byte mutation; they are explicitly **not physical readbacks**.

Production Storage v1/#33/milestone3 remains ACTIVE. M3's44.1kHz result stands,
48kHz/LR/repeat remain pending. No-SD boot, native internal MMC filesystems,
writability/persistence, display/input/audio retention, protected-byte readbacks
and rescue-negative behavior must be physically demonstrated. Expected RAM is
comparable to live AUDIO-02's954384KiB, with four CPUs; record the actual new value.
Do not close the milestone from SPFT completion. M4/M5 remain unstarted and
Y2PlayerNative remains deferred. **STOP here for the owner's manual operation.**
