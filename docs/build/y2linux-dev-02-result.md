# Y2LINUX-DEV-02 — root handoff ABI and wheel transaction corrections

**Built and physically booted; live core qualification retained, USB reconnect fails.**
[DEV-02 live qualification](../knowledge/y2linux-dev02-live-qualification.md).
Four CPUs, expanded RAM/short memory test, Buildroot Y2ROOT, input, visible display
and initial SSH/ECM/ACM work. The owner restart confirms persistent userspace fixes.
The original offline/deployment checkpoint follows as history.
[Deployment](y2linux-dev-02-deployment.md). The existing DEV-01 SD filesystem stays
in place; no second Buildroot compilation or SD rewrite is required.

Exact configs, ELF-derived layout, source manifest, unchanged rootfs images,
module update tar, logs, result.json and SHA256SUMS are in `out/y2linux-dev-02/`.
The new kernel identifies itself as 6.18.0-y2linux-dev02. LOG1/rootfs/USB serial
retain the DEV-01 userspace identity for compatibility with the installed SD.

## Evidence and corrections

[DEV-01 capture and owner photograph](../knowledge/y2linux-development-hardware-result.md)
confirm visible console, four CPUs, MemTotal954668KiB including HighTotal228352KiB,
advancing display vblank, matching GEM/OVL addresses and a successfully mounted
SD Y2ROOT. PID1 dies by SIGILL immediately after the switch-root message. The
exact faulting PC was not recorded, so no single cause is asserted as proved.

DEV-01 had `ARM_THUMB=n`, although the toolchain's ARMv7 glibc advertises Thumb-2
code. The actual v6.18 `arch/arm/mm/Kconfig` says disabling this support can break
signal handling when userspace switches ISA, including illegal-instruction
aborts. `KUSER_HELPERS=n` similarly removes fixed-address ABI helpers; the actual
packaged glibc contains a reference to 0xffff0fa0. Enable both supported userspace
contracts. This removes known configuration incompatibilities without replacing
glibc, selecting Debian, reducing RAM or changing the working display route.

`CONFIG_DEBUG_USER=y` with `user_debug=31` records future user faults instead of
leaving only the final PID1 exit signal. A small glibc child preflight is run while
rescue PID1 and its observer remain alive. It deliberately installs a Thumb
signal handler from ARM code and returns through the kernel, checks kuser version,
barrier and TLS helpers, creates/joins a glibc thread, executes VFP arithmetic,
reads the monotonic clock and checks one MiB of allocator memory. A five-second
alarm bounds it; failure leaves rescue selected. It does not prove every later
init path or turn the photograph into a known fault-PC trace.

`CONFIG_FB_DEVICE=y` restores the normal framebuffer userspace device missing
from DEV-01. Its color tool had logged ENOENT despite visible fbcon. Existing
480x360 timings, panel takeover, OVL format/address handling, PHY and mutex
programming are preserved. Actual pattern visibility/readback awaits DEV-02.

The wheel's controller diagnostics show op1 (write), transactions2, DMA finished
one-byte TX, no I2C completion and ten timeouts. Source review finds v6.18's
WRRD combination gated solely on `auto_restart`, whereas MT6582's selected
mt6577-compatible controller has `auto_restart=0`. It consequently requests
two writes with only the first message configured and waits indefinitely for
completion until the normal timeout. DEV-02 allows the already implemented WRRD
path for exactly `mediatek,mt6582-i2c` when two messages are write then read to
the same address. This sets direction change and 1/9-byte transfer lengths in
one hardware operation. APT32F register-zero/frame contract, clocks, pulls,
DMA channel, IRQ handling and timeout policy remain; no retries are added.
Hardware confirmation remains required.

## Validation and compatibility

One clean new kernel build, without warnings/errors; existing pinned Buildroot
binaries reused. Exact kernel/DRM module, DT, decompressor relocation, BOOTIMG
staging/overread and rescue archive checks pass. The physical bank and reservations
are unchanged; actual kernel span is10626240bytes and exact initrd length1562123.

Tests exercise the real patched I2C dispatch with non-auto-restart MT6582, the
existing modern path, nonmatching messages, invalid buffers and a single bounded
failed operation with balanced clocks. New config tests reject the actual old
DEV-01 ABI settings and independently disabled Thumb/helpers/fb-device/debug
support. A simulated SIGILL in the probe child leaves the rescue gate disabled.
Existing shared provider/PHY/relay/USB tests and DEV DT/layout/archive mutations
pass; the historical D08-specific baseline DT fixture is explicitly skipped by
the generic test script, with DEV actual-DT checks taking its place.

QEMU runs the actual ARM probe successfully, plus startup shell parsing and
Dropbear help. QEMU emulates the userspace kernel ABI; these results do not prove
real-Y2 signal handling. The linked kernel config and actual hardware preflight
provide the complementary checks. Read-only e2fsck and independent ext4/tar
checks of the unchanged rootfs/key/tools pass.

The new DRM module is loaded from rescue. SD userspace/observer binaries are
unchanged and skip module loading when DRM already exists. The old SD module
index therefore does not prevent this boot, but must be refreshed before later
module reloads. A root-owned, version-specific `sd-module-update.tar` is prepared
for installation on verified removable Y2ROOT over SSH after successful startup.
The module payload has no loader, partition, calibration or private-key contents.

The [boundary audit](../planning/roadmap-gap-audit.md#dev-02-root-handoff--wheel-correction-audit--2026-09-10)
keeps M2 active and incomplete. No device writes were executed by the assistant.
Next is one owner flash and integrated physical acceptance, not separate images
for the panic, wheel and framebuffer node.
