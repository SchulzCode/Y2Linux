# Risk-accepted first-boot diagnostic result

2026-09-08, Y2E-150 [#18](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/18).
**GO for one risk-accepted BOOTIMG-only diagnostic experiment, pending separate
owner hardware authorization. No flash, DA upload, experimental boot, physical
pin probing or live framebuffer/register write was performed.**

This supersedes the old no-watchdog UART-only candidate for the proposed test.
The original artifacts remain historical. [D11–D13 research and architecture](../knowledge/risk-accepted-diagnostic.md),
[exact experiment/restore procedure](../knowledge/first-experiment.md).

Research checkpoint: `3aeeb03`. Final implementation/build source:
`1234f857810f979bae821649c3202c2a9f132e0a`.
Git author/committer and GitHub account remain the owner's existing identity.

## Baseline, configuration and scope

Audited upstream v6.18, commit `7d0a66e4bb9081d75c82ec4957c50034cb0ea449`,
Linux release **6.18.0-y2-m1**. Clang/LLD **20.1.8**, locked Alpine environment,
Python **3.12.14**, QEMU user **10.0.0** for ARM instruction/PID1 selftests.
Full dependency revisions remain in `tools/build/inputs.lock.json`.

D09 Kconfig visibility overlay remains. Three further exact-base/exact-result
patches add the explicit Y2 diagnostic Kconfig flag, include the project board
helper in the built-in MediaTek object, and stop AP_RGU in compressed entry.
Every overlay is applied with zero fuzz and checked hashes; the source cache
remains pristine. The temporary helper includes use `/project`, the fixed
read-only project mount in the locked build environment. This is not a generic
upstream driver submission or an Android source port.

CPU0/ARMv7 little-endian/non-LPAE, static D08 memory, appended DTB enabled,
ATAG-to-DTB import disabled, no SMP/HIGHMEM/hyp stub. UART0/IRQ51/26 MHz stays
additional output, normal console 921600 8N1; earlycon retains LK baud.
`CONFIG_Y2_BOOT_DIAGNOSTIC=y`; ordinary watchdog, display, USB, eMMC/block,
network/audio/input and peripheral DMA stacks remain off. Procfs permits only
the implemented volatile diagnostic writes from PID1; no persistent filesystem
is mounted. Sysfs remains read-only. There is no shell, adbd, rootfs install,
display reinitialization or automatic reset/rollback.

BOOTIMG is 1,089,536 bytes in the 16,777,216-byte EMMC_USER BOOTIMG partition,
[0x01d80000,0x02d80000). It is unsigned. No stock loader was patched.

Local retained bundle:
`/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/m1-risk-accepted-diagnostic/`.
37 members have a SHA256SUMS inventory, including ELFs, config, image components,
logs, input/overlay manifests, diagnostic sources, entry disassembly and FM
boot/scatter convenience copies. The build source commit is in BUILD_COMMIT.
Development outputs outside this bundle are not launch candidates.

## D08 and actual occupied intervals

DT RAM remains [0x80000000,0x81800000) plus [0x84000000,0x84080000), with
[0x80000000,0x80004000) reserved. No imported LK memory ATAGs or RAM expansion.

| Object | Half-open physical interval |
| --- | --- |
| zimage | `[0x80008000,0x8010ee28)` |
| appended_dtb | `[0x8010ee28,0x8010f558)` |
| image | `[0x80008000,0x80274ec0)` |
| resident_kernel | `[0x80008000,0x8029d130)` |
| relocated_copy | `[0x80275700,0x8037cb60)` |
| relocated_dtb | `[0x8037c428,0x8037cb58)` |
| compressed_bss | `[0x8037cb58,0x8037cb78)` |
| malloc | `[0x8037db70,0x8038db70)` |
| initramfs | `[0x84000000,0x84000744)` |
| lk_staging | `[0x80007e00,0x80111600)` |

Stack top 0x8037db70; workspace ends 0x8038db70, below the fixed 0x81800000
boundary. Kernel BSS 164,464 bytes; resident span 2,707,760 bytes. D13 maps only
visible RGB565 pixels [0xbfb00000,0xbfb54600), 345,600 bytes, inside already
excluded high display storage. I/O mappings round to pages, but writes stay
strictly within the visible interval. This does not add allocator RAM.

## Validation and review

- Two fresh builds `diagnostic-reviewed-1` and `diagnostic-reviewed-2` match
  byte-for-byte across 12 outputs, including both ELFs, actual Image/zImage,
  DTB, init/archive, BOOTIMG and full layout report. Both complete build logs
  contain no compiler warnings/errors; all 11 tests pass in both trees.
- Existing D08 boundary/arithmetic, actual-artifact corruption and BOOTIMG
  wrapper/partition tests continue to pass (22 artifact mutations and 25
  package cases). No validation threshold or RAM bound was loosened.
- New compiled policy test rejects wrong/changed base, dimensions, offset,
  stride, format/source/alpha/key state, enabled watchdog, stopped/wrong DSI
  modes and invalid stage sequences. All five pixel patterns are checked at
  the exact visible-buffer bounds, with sentinel protection.
- Actual emitted ARM watchdog bytes and continuation branch are validated.
  QEMU executes the real block **including the branch over linker padding**
  against mock registers for four initial MODE values; r7/r8/r9 preservation
  and keyed enable-bit clearing pass. This is not a watchdog hardware model.
- Manual final disassembly: stop at zImage offset 0x90, write at 0xa4, readback
  at 0xac, fail loop at 0xb4, branch at 0xb8 to continuation 0xc0. Loader r1/r2
  have already been preserved in r7/r8; MMU-off SVC contract is unchanged.
  A development padding fall-through hazard was caught before approval, fixed,
  and both final builds rerun. No affected development image was flashed.
- PID1 ARM EABI selftest passes. Source review confirms writable volatile
  procfs for the root/PID1-only stage endpoint, checked timed heartbeat sleeps,
  finite ten-transition protocol and no block/device/reset operations.
- All 91,166 source files/links match the audited upstream archive. All 24 FM
  ROM files plus SPFT executable and bundled DA rehash successfully. Local
  preloader/LK files are byte-identical to the baseline; no device write occurred.

[Layout report](results/risk-diagnostic-layout.json),
[reproducibility](results/risk-diagnostic-reproducibility.json),
[source verification](results/risk-diagnostic-source-verification.json).
Private research captures and exact artifact slices are indexed in
[capture-index.tsv](../knowledge/capture-index.tsv).

Reproduce in the locked environment with unused output directories:

```sh
python3 tools/build/prepare.py --offline
python3 tools/build/full_source_check.py
python3 tools/build/run.py --output out/repro-a -- sh /project/tools/build/build.sh
python3 tools/build/run.py --output out/repro-b -- sh /project/tools/build/build.sh
python3 tools/observation/verify_recovery.py
```

For an empty cache, run prepare.py without --offline to fetch checksum-locked
inputs first. Source/overlay mismatch or any D08 failure stops the build;
never enlarge memory automatically.

## Risk-accepted launch assessment

Watchdog: the upstream driver cannot cover its pre-probe interval. The minimal
entry stop uses the upstream/LK MODE operation before inflation and rechecks
it before any visible stage. Other watchdogs, pending resets and protected
register access remain unmeasured risks.

Observation: inherited sync-pulse DSI video, LK layer 2 at 0xbfb00000,
480x360 RGB565/960-byte rows, with final normal boot convergence to that base
and no normal backlight-off. Read-only register guards precede every paint;
only pixels are written. This is a firmware/source-supported path, **not an
already successful Linux hardware capture**. Guard refusal can be silent
without UART; no guessed register reinitialization is attempted.

Expected sequence: LK logo → kernel black/white stripes → PID1 green after a
short hold → alternating white half on green every five seconds (ten times)
→ terminal checkerboard. A 60-second host observation cutoff includes startup
latency and takes precedence over completion of all stages. At least three
ordered timed heartbeat changes are the minimum useful success evidence.

Failure after a successful stop can remain frozen indefinitely. No automatic
rollback/reset or Linux power-button driver exists. Before entry/rejection or
if the stop fails, inherited watchdog IRQ/dual-mode resets may occur; exact
reset timing is not promised. The owner must use the proven power/recovery
sequence and restore FM BOOTIMG only after the single trial.

Fallback FM boot.img SHA-256:
`5ef1bdf28481ee0bf5f3528c1ddd91cf3f4d2d5f39e4d0ea049a8137a30f6af6`.
It restores known-good FM boot state, not exact current kernel/ramdisk changes.
The owner accepts rejection, failed boot, incomplete installed-loader/DMA/
secure-state proof and possible need for later FM recovery. Full-ROM recovery
can lose system/userdata and requires separate authorization; unique calibration
cannot be recreated from a generic ROM. All non-BOOTIMG targets remain forbidden.

**GO means the bounded risk-accepted diagnostic is ready for separate owner
review/authorization. Hardware success, stock serial capture and M1 hardware
completion are still unproved.** The next action is the prepared Y2B-240 issue,
not further features, automatic flashing or an unattended reset loop.

Execution checkpoint: [Y2B-240 / #19](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/19), awaiting separate owner hardware authorization.
