# Storage02 DIAG01 deployment

The installed Storage02 rescue reports missing/invalid internal Y2ROOT or Y2DATA.
Linux USB remains absent, including after the latest reported restart/attachment.
This temporary diagnostic shows the cached USB state, internal block identity,
root/data signature checks and kernel log tail on three rotating console pages.
It stays in rescue and mounts no block filesystem. It is not a root/USB fix.

Rescue source commit: `8bf2d6404ee7f93c9244b124d7acea035e37e6c3`.
Kernel/module source remains `c2db4893b79eca25458b6adc318232c80dd99872` and their bytes
are unchanged. DT differences are limited to log verbosity and initrd extent.
Package: `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-storage-diag-01/`.

SPFT v5.2032 **Download Only**, package scatter, **BOOTIMG only** selected.
ANDROID, USRDATA and every other partition must remain unchecked. Never Format
All or Firmware Upgrade. Stock BOOTIMG physical EMMC_USER start 0x01d80000,
span 0x01000000; scatter linear/global start 0x03180000 is not a physical readback
offset. Read back the 16 MiB span and compare its first manifest payload size
bytes to the BOOTIMG hash above, retaining original target/DA identity evidence.

After flashing, disconnect USB. Boot unplugged; attach once at least ten seconds
after Linux starts. No SD is required. Photograph PAGE 1, PAGE 2 and PAGE 3 as
they rotate at roughly twelve-second intervals. There is no SSH/root handover.
Expected empty-slot warnings stay in the kernel log without obscuring the screen.

[Complete install and exact BOOTIMG-only restoration](storage-diagnostic-install.md).
Returning to Storage02 uses its original 5187584-byte BOOTIMG with SHA256
6dfe7ff5de30f39581cc3479ed17d9a2fbf6671619741924d563f29114228d7d.
The known AUDIO-02 + original SD fallback is also documented there. No root/data,
loader/table/calibration restoration is part of either BOOTIMG-only path.

PASS seven targeted tests, ARM reader/rejections/blkid, shell syntax, exact base
kernel/module, unchanged DT hardware fields, newc/D08/BOOTIMG/scatter and hashes.
Physical display of these diagnostic pages is pending. Storage #33 remains active;
no internal-root acceptance or new protected-byte readback is claimed.
**Stop for the owner's manual diagnostic flash. No assistant device write.**
