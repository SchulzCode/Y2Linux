# Y2LINUX-GPU-02 — targeted suspend correction

**Built and validated; STOP for owner manual deployment.** Source commit
`7e318afbffe640c6bf9da458f61ac2108f7d5bde`. The integrated package is
`/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-gpu-02`.

[GPU-01 physically renders correctly](../hardware-evidence/2026-09-18-gpu01/README.md)
with Lima/Mesa, runtime power-off, clean wired audio and zero radio errors.
Its suspend check exposes incorrect secondary-CPU status masks and a userspace
all-off status mismatch. GPU-02 corrects only those checks and release identities.
No PCM, GPU/display/radio architecture, voltage, clock policy or RAM map changes.
GPU #34 remains OPEN; **Y2Linux is not ready to begin Reborn**.

The assistant has not flashed or replaced installed production code. The live
GPU-01 boot remains on CPUs 0–2 with SPM broken=1 after the bounded failure;
do not attempt more hotplug/deep sleep on that boot. Normal charging and SSH
remain operational. GPU-01 artifacts remain immutable.

## Required platform receipt

| Item | Implementation and physical evidence |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Source | `7e318afbffe640c6bf9da458f61ac2108f7d5bde`, matching kernel/root receipts. This commit also records GPU-01 physical evidence. |
| 2. Exact GPU | **Mali-400 MP2**, established from own stock and physically probed/rendered by mainline Lima on GPU-01. |
| 3. Revision | **r1p1**, GP `0x0b070101`, PP `0x0cd070101`; both PP cores version 1.1. No independent MMU revision register is established. All three MMU initialization handshakes and real rendering succeed on GPU-01. |
| 4. MMIO | Mali `0x13010000/0x10000`: GP +0, L2 +0x1000, GP MMU +0x3000, PP MMUs +0x4000/+0x5000, PP cores +0x8000/+0xa000. MFGCFG `0x13000000/0x10`. Existing SPM `0x10006000`, MFG control +0x214. |
| 5. IRQs | GIC hwirq 202–207 / DT SPI 170–175, active-low: GP, GP-MMU, PP0, PP0-MMU, PP1, PP1-MMU. Existing sysirq owns polarity. |
| 6. Clocks | Existing CCF: MMPLL → MFG selector 1/top gate bit23 at TOPCKGEN +0x50 → G3D MFGCFG bit0. Bus uses existing `mm_smi_common`; its inherited reported rate is unresolved and not retuned. |
| 7. Reset/domain | Sole SPM owner exports MFG genpd, stock dual power ACK/isolation/reset/SRAM sequence. Source clock spans domain transitions; Lima gates G3D. GPU-02 corrects **CPU** ACK/boot masks to 0x800/0x400/0x200 and combined deep-entry guard to 0xe00, as proved by the actual Y2 stock binary and physical CPU3 bit9 transition. MFG sequencing is unchanged. |
| 8. Frequency | One inherited **500.5 MHz** register-derived rate, nominal stock 500 MHz. This Y2's retained devinfo[3] bit19 is 0, selecting stock MMPLL. No retuning/overclock/guessed DVFS. Unexpected loader PLL/mux state fails activation. |
| 9. Voltage | Preserve inherited supply. No established separate GPU regulator, `mali-supply` or voltage/OPP writes. Stock profiling's nominal 1.2 V is not a measured rail. |
| 10. Kernel/Lima | Linux **6.18**, `DRM_LIMA=y`, `DRM_GEM_SHMEM_HELPER=y`, `DRM_SCHED=y`, `PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS=y`, `PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS_OF=y`, `PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS_SLEEP=y`. Compatible `mediatek,mt6582-mali`, `arm,mali-400`. Standard Lima with initial probe PM-reference balancing. |
| 11. Mesa | **24.0.9**, pinned by Buildroot/source hashes; unchanged from physically working GPU-01. |
| 12. Mesa Lima | `gallium-drivers=[lima,kmsro]`, LLVM disabled, OSMesa false, Vulkan drivers empty; no software rasterizer or proprietary Android Mali userspace. |
| 13. EGL | Enabled; GBM platform. GPU-01 physically reports **Mesa Project / EGL 1.4 / config 7**. |
| 14. GLES | GLES1/GLES2 enabled; tested **OpenGL ES 2.0 Mesa 24.0.9**, GL vendor **Mesa**, renderer **Mali400**, maximum texture edge **4096**, 16 texture units. |
| 15. GBM/libdrm | GBM enabled, libdrm **2.4.124**, ARM hard-float; Lima and Mediatek kmsro DRI libraries. No GLX/X11/Wayland desktop. |
| 16. Memory/MMU | GEM/shmem, normal pages, standard noncoherent ARM DMA/PRIME, 32-bit DMA and GPU VA, 4-KiB pages. No carveout/CMA addition or changed RAM exclusions. Small KMS scanout allocations require contiguous DMA; large allocation/fragmentation limits remain untested. |
| 17. Presentation | Existing Mediatek KMS allocates linear **XRGB8888**, kmsro exports dma-buf to Lima for direct rendering/scanout. Native **480×360**, reported mode 63 Hz, 30-FPS utility cap, one page flip outstanding. No CPU presentation copy. GPU-01 proves correct textures/alpha/layers and 3599 flips in 120 seconds. |
| 18. Runtime PM | Mainline Lima 200-ms autosuspend, job references, G3D gating then MFG off. GPU-01 proves initial idle, post-render idle and live-static-context domain-off idle plus on-demand redraw. |
| 19. Suspend | Lima force-suspend/resume and genpd callbacks return successfully in the retained staged test. Corrected CPU masks and radio zero matcher remove concrete blockers. **Real same-session deep resume and EGL preservation are still unqualified.** Existing charging inhibition policy remains authoritative. |
| 20. Buildroot | **2025.02.17**, Mesa/Lima/kmsro, EGL/GLES/GBM and bounded `y2-gpu-check`/`y2-gpu-collect`. GPU-02 only updates `y2-suspend` and build markers in Y2ROOT; BOOTIMG owns kernel/DT/display module. Existing ALSA/connectivity/persistent-state paths remain. |

[Full GPU hardware/API/license contract](../knowledge/gpu-platform.md).
Reborn will use DRM/KMS + GBM + EGL + GLES2, with RGBA8888 textures and GLES
source-alpha blending into XRGB8888 scanout (EGL config7 has alpha bits0).
Query configs/extensions at runtime. Render on change, cap normal animation
at 30 FPS and stop drawing when static. Deep-resume context preservation is
still a gate; support standard EGL_CONTEXT_LOST recreation, not Mali registers.

## 21–24. Images, Y2DATA and fallback

All paths are relative to `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-gpu-02`.

| Role | File | Bytes | SHA256 |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| GPU-02 BOOTIMG | `BOOTIMG.img` | 6203392 | `2e5f7e785e80dfc646e57d0ccfadff683d54a2c5303671c819ea4e42863089a9` |
| GPU-02 Y2ROOT | `Y2ROOT.img` | 536870912 | `1dec3b9c462587d804a022ef97e45222329065d263f53c2159ce00f728db145f` |
| CONNECTIVITY-10 fallback BOOTIMG | `fallback/BOOTIMG.img` | 6150144 | `d7fbb0808db953a7c8d26f3846815b7b5fbc67caa1b86248d7f992dba51f30a7` |
| CONNECTIVITY-07 fallback Y2ROOT | `fallback/Y2ROOT.img` | 536870912 | `c5031c2e87e02258d9da16a424ba727001d367ce76aa3366b5c70f6bef2d68fd` |

**Preserve Y2DATA in place.** No data payload, format, seed or migration.
USRDATA and all protected rows stay unchecked/filename NONE. Saved networks,
Bluetooth bonds, machine/radio identities, SSH keys and user files remain.
BOOTIMG/Y2ROOT retain the existing OTA component boundary; OTA is not implemented.
Fallback copies restore the accepted connectivity baseline, not a newly tested
suspend result. The newly exposed CPU-mask defect predates GPU integration.

Host validation: **94 tests** (56 + 38), corrected CPU ACK/guard failure replay,
radio helper status replay, emitted DT/kernel/rescue/BOOTIMG checks, ARM ABI and
bounded utility arguments, raw-ext4 root helper/marker/source agreement, clean
ext4/UUID, graphics libraries, exact fallbacks and **nine package rejection cases**.
The emitted DTB is byte-identical to GPU-01, SHA256
`c988d2d9316ca3cb8529ae39e576c502d0d2b2f373acc2667c9ea86282b69c6b`;
dtschema2026.6 validation passes. [Build receipts](evidence/y2linux-gpu-02/README.md).
These checks do not prove the corrected physical sleep path.

## 25. Exact manual installation

1. On the host verify the complete package:

   ```sh
   cd /home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-gpu-02
   sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
   ```

2. Use the established owner shutdown/USB/power entry procedure and proven
   **SP Flash Tool v5.2032.00** with the matching `MTK_AllInOne_DA.bin`.
3. Load this package's **`MT6582_preserve_data_scatter.txt`**. Use
   **Download Only** and review exactly these selections:

   | SPFT row | Selection | File |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | BOOTIMG | checked | GPU-02 `BOOTIMG.img` |
   | ANDROID | checked | GPU-02 `Y2ROOT.img` |
   | USRDATA and every other row | unchecked | NONE |

   Keep PRELOADER, partition tables, LK, recovery, calibration/protected rows and
   media unchecked. No Format, Firmware Upgrade or raw-address entry.
4. Manually download **both** payloads and boot normal Linux, preserving existing
   Y2DATA. Do not mix GPU-02 BOOTIMG with GPU-01 root; both contain a correction.
5. Report “GPU-02 running”. Expected markers are `6.18.0-y2linux-gpu-02`,
   `/etc/y2linux/build-id` = `Y2LINUX-GPU-02`, and source `7e318af…` above.
   Existing pinned SSH identity/authorization remains.

If restoring the fallback, use `fallback/MT6582_preserve_data_scatter.txt` with
its own two files, Download Only, and the same preservation selections. All
physical installation/recovery remains the owner's operation.

## 26. Targeted physical qualification

Keep the completed GPU-01 rendering/performance/thermal evidence. Do not restart
discovery or run another entry audit. Retain logs on the host and in a dedicated
Y2DATA qualification directory before any sleep attempt.

1. Confirm both markers/source, taint0, all four CPUs, SPM broken=0, healthy
   charging, saved preferences and Lima revision/render node. Run one short
   visible GLES animation.
2. Start a bounded static EGL client and wait for its first `STATIC_READY`.
   Verify runtime/domain idle. With existing charge inhibition, run installed
   `y2-suspend` under **`pm_test=core`**. Require successful CPU3/2/1 off,
   all four CPUs restored, SPM broken=0, unchanged boot ID and same-context USR1
   redraw. Restore `pm_test=none`; stop on any failure before actual deep sleep.
3. Schedule an RTC alarm only when none exists and perform real deep sleep
   with the static client quiesced. Require meaningful residency, SPM entry/
   resume increments, unchanged boot ID and redraw using the same EGL context.
   Restore prior charging policy and clear only the test alarm. Check panel,
   backlight and SSH; record any EGL context loss.
4. Repeat with no GPU client, using brief Power wake when the owner is ready
   and a bounded RTC backup, then start a fresh renderer. A new boot, black
   screen, crash or required cable recovery does not pass same-session resume.
5. During a clearly timed animation, verify all controls overlap rendering;
   the GPU-01 input observation window extended past its animation. Check quiet
   wired audio and radio counters after resume, preserving saved preferences.
6. Owner performs the existing targeted offline-charge animation/normal-boot
   check. Record panel/backlight restoration without a full M4 rerun.
7. Check root/data, charging watchdog, temperatures, GPU/kernel errors and radio
   zero-error/zero-recovery counters; restore original runtime settings.

Association/WPA2/DHCP/DNS/reconnect, Bluetooth real-peer/SBC/AVRCP and sustained
Wi-Fi traffic + Bluetooth audio + GPU remain **pending by owner choice**.
GPU #34 stays OPEN and Reborn readiness stays NO until the remaining physical
gates pass. Do not start Reborn or M6/OTA.
