# First manual Production Storage v1 deployment

> Superseded for retry: first ANDROID sparse transfer failed3154. See [failure proof](../hardware-evidence/2026-09-13-storage-flash-failure/README.md); corrected Storage02 raw package is being prepared. Do not retry the original .spft.img files.

**READY at the manual package boundary; NOT physically qualified.** No assistant
physical eMMC write or SPFT operation. First actual eMMC/rootfs qualification
belongs to the owner. The latest live system remains SD-backed AUDIO-02.

1. **Build Git commit:** `f2ef297a81cc0229155ba5d96f1955bdd230f11d`.
   Canonical project SchulzCode/Y2Linux; existing Luca/SchulzCode identity retained.
   Later evidence-only commits do not change these built bytes.
2. **Exact stock map** and 3. **classification of every entry** follow. All normal
   starts are physical EMMC_USER bytes; the full machine-readable map includes
   distinct scatter linear values, stock runtime mappings and provenance.

PRELOADER is EMMC_BOOT_1: the scatter's20MiB span is a vendor abstraction,
**not** a physical readback length; each boot hardware region is4MiB. BMTPOOL's
sentinels remain UNKNOWN/unapproved. FAT's zero scatter span resolves physically
to0x15dc00000 bytes and may contain user media; leave it alone. EMMC_USER capacity
is7,784,103,936 bytes. Preserve MBR/EBR1/EBR2; no repartitioning occurs.

4. **Y2ROOT choice:** ANDROID, ext4 LABEL=Y2ROOT.
5. **Original purpose/name:** stock ANDROID `/system`, historically stock Linux p5.
6. **Physical start:** 0x05180000 =85,458,944 bytes; scatter linear0x06580000.
7. **Partition size:** 0x33400000 =859,832,320 bytes (820MiB).
8. **Raw Y2ROOT image size:** 536,870,912 bytes (512MiB).
9. **Raw Y2ROOT SHA256:** `041fbd7fbe0a2966e178649ff958cb3ad3cfea1610ef75aa580ba2391b1f5be8`.
10. **Y2DATA:** stock USRDATA (`/data`, historical p7), physical0x40380000
    =1,077,411,840 bytes, size0x32000000 =838,860,800 bytes (800MiB).
    ext4 LABEL=Y2DATA mounted /data; initializes Android data on first install.
    UUIDs are79324c69-6e75-4801-8000-000000000101 (root) and
    79324c69-6e75-4801-8000-000000000102 (data). Root detection checks native
    internal host and stock geometry, not fixed mmcblk numbers.

11. **BOOTIMG**, 12. **scatter**, 13. **manifest**, and filesystem transports:

All files below are in `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-production-v1/`.

The scatter maps the **.spft.img** filesystem files. Their expanded content is
byte-for-byte identical to the raw .img; never compare sparse-file hashes with
physical eMMC hashes. BOOTIMG is raw, at physical0x01d80000 within its16MiB span.
The first scatter selects BOOTIMG/ANDROID/USRDATA; the preserving profile selects
BOOTIMG/ANDROID only.

14. **Restoration material for every overwritten partition:** verified original
    FM sources below exist locally in
    `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Player/y2_v3.2.0_FM-20260813/`.
    They restore factory Android, not personalized installed Android state.
    Preserve a private USRDATA readback before install if original settings/apps
    must be recoverable; likewise ANDROID if its modifications matter. Keep an
    independent accessible copy of recovery material. No full-ROM rebackup needed.

| Overwritten partition | Verified stock source | Bytes | SHA256 |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| BOOTIMG | boot.img | 5656576 | `5ef1bdf28481ee0bf5f3528c1ddd91cf3f4d2d5f39e4d0ea049a8137a30f6af6` |

| USRDATA | userdata.img | 15290768 | `552e325ecf2faffeb9351022147bbfda3b7cebe25df491b2d732e85c5c68f27c` |

15. **SPFT boxes to select:** BOOTIMG→BOOTIMG.img,
    ANDROID→Y2ROOT.spft.img, USRDATA→Y2DATA.spft.img for FIRST installation only.
16. **Boxes NEVER selected in this installation:** PRELOADER, MBR, EBR1,
    PRO_INFO, NVRAM, PROTECT_F, PROTECT_S, SECCFG, UBOOT/LK, RECOVERY, SEC_RO,
    MISC, LOGO, EBR2, EXPDB, CACHE, FAT, BMTPOOL.
17. **Download Only procedure:** use owner-proven SPFTv5.2032 and its DA, verify
    package checksums, retain before readbacks/table identity, load the package's
    first-install scatter, review all21 rows, select exactly the3 above, choose
    Download Only, and use the established owner USB/power entry sequence.
    No Format All + Download, Firmware Upgrade, Write Memory, table changes or
    workaround if SPFT reports an identity/table/image error. Remove SD before
    first normal production boot. [Exact install procedure](../architecture/production-install.md).
18. **Readback/verification:** before the write capture the13 bounded EMMC_USER
    KEEP ranges in metadata/readback-plan.json. The verifier checks original
    MBR/EBR prefixes with `--before-only`; after download recapture these ranges
    plus full BOOTIMG16MiB, ANDROID820MiB and USRDATA800MiB, **before boot**.
    Compare protected ranges exactly and target raw-image prefixes by SHA256:

```
python3 tools/production/verify_readback.py --package out/y2linux-production-v1 --before /path/to/before --before-only
python3 tools/production/verify_readback.py --package out/y2linux-production-v1 --before /path/to/before --after /path/to/after
```

Physical starts are BOOTIMG0x1d80000, ANDROID0x5180000, USRDATA0x40380000;
scatter linear starts are0x3180000,0x6580000,0x41780000. SPFT normal Download
uses its original scatter mapping; EMMC_USER Readback uses physical offsets.
Linux whole-disk offsets are those same physical values, while a partition node
starts at offset0. No custom DA/global offsets are guessed. Preserve logs proving
which device/DA/region was read; file hashes alone cannot establish that.

19. **Expected first boot:** stock ROM→preloader→LK→Linux6.18.0-y2linux-storage01
    rescue→internal Y2ROOT/Y2DATA→switch_root→Buildroot. Discovery allows40s.
20. **Expected no-SD boot:** identical boot path; removable SD is ignored by the
    root resolver. Later SD serves media through explicit `y2-media mount`;
    nothing autoformats it. Old SD root labels cannot hijack production boot.
21. **Expected SSH/USB:** initial ACM diagnostics and usb0 at10.42.0.1/24,
    key-only SSH after normal Buildroot boot. New per-owner client private key
    lives OUTSIDE the package at
    `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-production-private/id_ed25519`.
    Keep it private and backed up separately. Only its new public key is inside
    Y2DATA. Dropbear generates new host keys on-device and persists them on /data.
    First key generation can wait for kernel entropy; historical delay was~154s.
    Use a separate host alias for the new production identity:

```
ssh -F /dev/null -o HostKeyAlias=y2linux-production-v1 -i /home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-production-private/id_ed25519 root@10.42.0.1
```

Verify the new host key. No development private key or universal production
credential is packaged. USB cable reconnect remains a known deferred limitation.

22. **Rescue failure behavior:** missing/ambiguous/wrong label/UUID/geometry,
    root/data marker failure, failed executable preflight, unrepairable fsck or
    mount failure retains rescue PID1 and ACM diagnostics. No automatic format,
    SD fallback or reboot loop. There is no rescue SSH service. Stock UART/console
    shell remains where usable; ACM keeps one log writer. Final handover crashes
    and pre-gadget faults are outside this fallback's guarantee. A torn BOOTIMG
    can require SPFT because its own rescue may no longer load.
23. **Exact restoration:** quickest Linux fallback: original scatter,
    Download Only, deselect all, BOOTIMG only→the preserved AUDIO-02 image
    (4816896bytes, SHA256b9dbf6b528e4afbee2a5ffb2fc65df7f6a076564e92960332e24cee3809b5842),
    verify readback prefix, insert original SD and boot. It disables eMMC and
    leaves new internal root/data intact. Factory Android restoration instead
    selects ONLY BOOTIMG→FM boot.img, ANDROID→FM system.img,
    USRDATA→FM userdata.img; it destroys Y2DATA. Never restore loaders/tables/
    calibration as part of either route. [Full restoration/readback procedure](../architecture/production-recovery.md).
24. **Future OTA support:** independent kernel/root/app versions and hashes,
    stable layout1 geometry, explicit component/partition allowlists and ABI/schema
    requirements. BOOTIMG-only updates must supply/validate matching DRM modules;
    Y2ROOT image replacement preserves /data. Future app bundles can live under
    /data/apps/y2player/releases with atomic activation and /data/y2player state,
    alongside a future built-in Buildroot package. No app partition or app/updater
    code is implemented. Staged rescue updates are preferred to forced A/B;
    interrupted BOOTIMG uses external SPFT recovery. No repartition is needed for
    this direction. [Update/installer contract](../architecture/update-model.md).

## Validation and remaining physical boundary

PASS24 regression tests, emitted kernel/DT/D08 memory/BOOTIMG checks, matching
DRM module, ARM ABI and ALSA utilities, rescue shell syntax, ext4 e2fsck checks,
label/UUID, root/data contents and ownership, sparse RAW/FILL expansion hashes,
all21 stock scatter coordinates/no overlap, allowlists, versions and package
hash inventory. Synthetic readback tests reject both root-image corruption and
protected-byte mutation; they are explicitly **not physical readbacks**.

Production Storage v1/#33/milestone3 remains ACTIVE. M3's44.1kHz result stands,
48kHz/LR/repeat remain pending. No-SD boot, native internal MMC filesystems,
writability/persistence, display/input/audio retention, protected-byte readbacks
and rescue-negative behavior must be physically demonstrated. Expected RAM is
comparable to live AUDIO-02's954384KiB, with four CPUs; record the actual new value.
Do not close the milestone from SPFT completion. M4/M5 remain unstarted and
Y2PlayerNative remains deferred. **STOP here for the owner's manual operation.**
