# M1 offline first-boot result

2026-09-08, revised by [Y2E-140 / D10](../knowledge/observation-path.md) to UART0/IRQ51 after installed-stock evidence. The previous UART3 candidate is superseded; its [layout](results/m1-uart3-superseded-layout.json) and [hash inventory](results/m1-uart3-superseded-reproducibility.json) remain historical evidence. **Offline candidate built and validated; no experimental device boot or flash performed.** M0 and M1 hardware completion remain open. [Checkpoint history](../planning/M1-first-boot.md), [reproduction commands](first-boot.md), [launch gates and conditional experiment](../knowledge/first-boot-launch-gates.md).

## Baseline and configuration

Linux **6.18.0-y2-m1**, upstream tag v6.18 / commit `7d0a66e4bb9081d75c82ec4957c50034cb0ea449`, plus the single [D09 Kconfig visibility patch](kernel-policy.md). Clang/LLD **20.1.8** from the checksum-locked Alpine userspace; full package revisions in `tools/build/inputs.lock.json`. Build epoch `1764542530` (tag time), fixed build counter 1, UTC/C locale and stable build paths. Git author/committer identity was preserved throughout.

ARMv7 ARM instruction mode, EABI little-endian, CPU0 only, MMU/non-LPAE, `PHYS_OFFSET=0x80000000`, `PAGE_OFFSET=0xc0000000`, no highmem or runtime physical-address patching. `ARM_APPENDED_DTB=y`, `ARM_ATAG_DTB_COMPAT=n`, `ARM_VIRT_EXT=n`, gzip kernel/external newc initramfs, OF/GIC/sysirq/GPT, proc/sysfs and 8250/MT6577 candidate console. SMP, block/eMMC, networking, USB, display, sound, input, peripheral DMA, CMA, kexec and watchdog driver are disabled. Kernel fallback is `rdinit=/init`; DT supplies the controlled diagnostic command line. Full resolved config SHA-256: `27d41c25ab84cdbff5d134323ca386707ee8b64655cf904dd526b3387c01e7c0`.

DTB totalsize is 1,835 bytes, padded to 1,840 when appended. Uncompressed newc is 4,096 bytes containing one 2,740-byte static executable and fixed directories/device nodes; gzip is 1,582 bytes. The image is unsigned; Android SHA-1 ID is only legacy metadata.

## Exact D08 map and actual occupied intervals

All addresses below are physical and half-open. DT memory is **`[0x80000000,0x81800000)` + `[0x84000000,0x84080000)`**, 24.5 MiB described RAM; permanent FDT reservation `[0x80000000,0x80004000)`. Page directory is `[0x80004000,0x80008000)`. Excluded from all memory nodes: `[0x81800000,0x84000000)` and `[0x84080000,0xc0000000)`, preserving D08's loader/high-memory uncertainty and identified modem/connectivity/display/preloader storage. No RAM expansion or LK memory import occurred.

| Actual occupant / phase | Interval |
| --- | --- |
| zimage | `[0x80008000,0x8010eb68)` |
| appended_dtb | `[0x8010eb68,0x8010f298)` |
| image | `[0x80008000,0x80274ec0)` |
| resident_kernel | `[0x80008000,0x8029d130)` |
| relocated_copy | `[0x80275700,0x8037c8c0)` |
| relocated_dtb | `[0x8037c188,0x8037c8b8)` |
| compressed_bss | `[0x8037c8b8,0x8037c8d8)` |
| malloc | `[0x8037d8d0,0x8038d8d0)` |
| initramfs | `[0x84000000,0x8400062e)` |
| lk_staging | `[0x80007e00,0x80111600)` |
| staged_initramfs | `[0x8010f800,0x8010fe2e)` |

Relocation delta is `0x26d620`; actual compressed code allowance Q is `0x900`. LC1 stack top is `0x8037d8d0`; 64 KiB malloc ends at **`0x8038d8d0`**, below the fixed low-bank end `0x81800000`. The compressed BSS interval includes clear-loop rounding. Kernel BSS is 164,464 bytes and resident `_text.._end` is 2,707,760 bytes. Relocated DTB is beyond the whole resident kernel; no second relocation or live decompressor/output overlap is needed. Kernel BSS may later reuse discarded decompressor code, as allowed by D08.

BOOTIMG has 2048-byte header/pages and 512-byte KERNEL/ROOTFS wrappers. Declared legacy addresses remain `0x10008000`/`0x11000000`/`0x10000100`; LK runtime entry/copy addresses are the physical map above. The complete partition-relative LK read ends at `0x0010a000`, exactly covered by the file and below `0x01000000`. All trailing read padding is explicitly zero. BOOTIMG partition is `[0x01d80000,0x02d80000)`; a later file write would occupy `[0x01d80000,0x01e8a000)` before any transport-specific erase behavior, which must be separately reviewed.

## Validation evidence and limits

- [Actual symbol/layout/DT/package report](results/m1-layout.json): **PASS** every D08 cap and collision/workspace/DTB-survival constraint, config/ELF/Image/gzip/DTB agreement, wrappers, checksums and overread/partition bounds.
- [Reproducibility report](results/m1-reproducibility.json): **PASS**, 11 outputs byte-identical in two separate clean build directories, including both ELFs, full config and all deployable bytes.
- [Full source verification](results/m1-source-verification.json): **PASS**, 91,166 files/links match the locked release archive (redundant relative-link syntax normalized by safe extraction). The only build-time overlay is the reviewed Kconfig line.
- Nine tests pass with no skips in complete builds, including 22 real-artifact mutation cases (including rejection of the superseded UART3 base and IRQ), 25 package mutation/extent cases, fixed-policy boundaries and bounded gzip/cpio checks. QEMU 10.0.0 Cortex-A7 user-mode self-test passes. Kernel and dtc builds have no warning/error diagnostics.

Artifacts, both required ELFs, config, logs and provenance are retained locally under `out/m1-uart0-first-boot/` in the canonical Y2Linux checkout; caches/products are deliberately excluded from Git. Committed reports contain exact hashes and reproduction instructions. These are host verification results, not hardware execution, measured MemTotal, authenticated-loader acceptance, DMA containment or recovery backups. Runtime working set and board GIC/GPT/UART behavior remain untested. No full dt-schema claim is made.

## Stop boundary and proposed first experiment

The [launch-gate review](../knowledge/first-boot-launch-gates.md) leaves U07b (installed loader/authentication), U07c (inherited DMA/secure/SVC and watchdog state), U10a (physical console/voltage/routing and stock capture), and same-device independent backups/exact recovery procedure/trusted power unresolved. Owner-proven SPFT recovery remains accepted; no broad re-test is imposed.

After these proofs and separate authorization, the proposed experiment is one BOOTIMG-only deployment through the owner's proven, precisely recorded SPFT/DA route, one normal LK launch, captured Linux/CPU0/D08 diagnostics and at least three heartbeats within a reviewed 60-second observation window, followed by BOOTIMG-only stock restoration and checks. No preloader/LK, table, calibration, Android/system/userdata or rootfs change. The exact DA/entry/readback/wiring recipe remains blocked on those proofs; no verified temporary fastboot boot route is assumed. **No experimental launch: all remaining gates and separate authorization are still required.**
