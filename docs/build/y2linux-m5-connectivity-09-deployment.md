# CONNECTIVITY-09 — permanent MT6582 E2 HCI page correction

**Owner-installed CONNECTIVITY-09 reaches standard hci0/BlueZ on normal boot,
and normal BlueZ power-on/off succeeds.** No diagnostic module or runtime
correction is needed; core errors/recoveries and kernel taint remain 0.
[Physical -09 verification](../hardware-evidence/2026-09-17-m5-connectivity09/README.md).
The HCI initialization defect was page 2 of Read Local Extended Features: page 1
advertises maximum 2, but page 2 returns status `0x30`. Linux's existing quirk
and verified page limit 1 fix it without changing EDR/LE feature/command bits.
[Physical result and limits](../hardware-evidence/2026-09-17-m5-connectivity08/README.md).

This installed image makes the correction permanent, only for chip `6582`, HVR
`8a01`, FVR `8a00`. The -08 RF calibration correction, patches, factory provider,
DMA, M4 and memory/storage layout remain intact. Wi-Fi still fails after its
Start command; no Wi-Fi fix or full radio qualification is claimed.

[Validation receipts](evidence/y2linux-m5-connectivity-09/README.md): 15 targeted
connectivity tests, one clean build, emitted D08/DT/memory/BOOTIMG checks and
BOOTIMG-only package validation. Normal-boot adapter registration and a
standard runtime power-on/off are now physically verified on this -09 image.

## Owner installation and verified observation

The owner has completed this installation. The retained procedure below is
for reproducibility; another installation is not required for this checkpoint.

The existing deployment contract reserves installation for the owner. Verify
`sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` in the package directory. Use the established SP Flash
Tool setup, `MT6582_BOOTIMG_only_scatter.txt`, **Download Only**, and **BOOTIMG →
BOOTIMG.img only**. Preserve ANDROID/Y2ROOT, USRDATA/Y2DATA, loaders, tables and
protected partitions. No Format/Firmware Upgrade or assistant flash.

USB SSH verifies -09 with `uname -r`, the WMT 630-byte calibration success,
`bluetoothctl list/show`, and one standard runtime-only power-on/off while
retaining saved preferences. The BlueZ adapter appears without any diagnostic
module or runtime patch. No factory/DMA/identification re-investigation occurs.

Fallback selects only BOOTIMG, using `fallback/BOOTIMG-previous.img` (-08).
It keeps the RF fix but retains the unfixed HCI page-2 failure on a fresh boot;
the temporary live HCI quirk does not survive reboot. Accepted M4 fallback
artifacts remain documented in the original M5 handoff.

The verified -09 session is returned to both radios off, with saved preferences
still 0 and the BlueZ adapter still visible. Pairing, A2DP, BLE/EDR data and
coexistence remain unqualified. M5 stays open; GPU/Reborn remain out of scope.
