# M2-USBACM-01 — ready for owner enumeration test

> Subsequent [owner photograph](../knowledge/m2-usbacm-hardware-result.md) shows
> successful unplugged-start PHY wake, then US:2 RC:-16 from a live PWRAP poll.
> No enumeration result. The original handoff below is retained as history;
> M2-USBACM-02 adds the missing failed-poll evidence.

Screen/build **M2-USBACM-01**, Linux **6.18.0-y2-m2-usbacm1**.
[Hardware/software contract](../knowledge/m2-usb-enumeration.md),
[host capture procedure](usb-log-capture.md).

## Combined attempt

This replaces the proposed extra USBGUARD-only test with one guarded attempt at
controller/session ownership → upstream MUSB peripheral PIO → one g_serial CDC
ACM → retained kernel/PID1 and live heartbeat logs. The CHRDET result already
answered the immediate presence question. It did not establish that the PHY's
connected-start state can be recovered; the candidate therefore starts unplugged.

The initial wake guard remains unchanged. Once it passes, the screen asks for
attachment. Fresh supply/clock/PHY/DMA checks gate the exact LK/FM digital
device-session sequence. FIFO readback gates connection. The original screen
snapshot and signed failure stage remain available if any step refuses/fails.
No PMIC writes, host VBUS sourcing, analog calibration writes or DMA transfer.
This is an enumeration **attempt**, not a promise of hardware success.

## Validation

- One clean pinned Linux 6.18/Clang 20.1.8 candidate build; no compiler warnings
  or errors. **23 full-suite methods**, **one additional linked-syscall mutation
  method**, and **eight observation methods** pass. This includes 30 QEMU ARM
  PID1 paths, production session/takeover guards, 49 existing wake scenarios,
  and host/ARM relay fault, partial-write, overflow and replay cases.
- The complete real-artifact corruption suite rejects changed USB IRQ polarity,
  host mode and PIO configuration as well as the existing D08/package faults.
  Linked MUSB/EP0/ACM/serial implementations and ARM mknod14/lseek19/ioctl54 are
  present, not ENOSYS; sleep162 still resolves to nanosleep_time32. No linked
  USB DMA engine, host setup or sibling MediaTek adapter. Resolved USB/selected
  dependency configuration and exact experimental DT node pass validation.
- Linked access review retains the PHY6c/6d-only byte-store callback, DEVCTL
  SESSION/HR suppression, error-dependent SOFTCONN gate, MAC interrupt widths/
  W1C path, second eight-channel inactive-DMA sample, bounded worker and IRQ
  cutoff. Source hashes match the built diagnostic/relay sources. This is an
  offline software/access check; FIFO/IRQ/USB electrical behavior awaits hardware.
- D08 still describes 24MiB+512KiB, CPU0 only. Kernel resident span, decompressor
  workspace and initramfs remain within its unchanged limits; no RAM expansion.
  Initramfs gzip 9175 bytes. Complete LK read-tail and 16MiB BOOTIMG bounds pass.
  See [layout](results/m2-usbacm-01-layout.json) and
  [iteration record](results/m2-usbacm-01-iteration.json).
- Output retains config/ELFs/build/test logs, focused disassembly, source snapshot,
  input lock, hashes and host capture tooling. No duplicate successful build or
  repeated unchanged Linux/ROM/recovery provenance audit.

## Owner test — stop here

1. Use the established **BOOTIMG-only** procedure for this exact image. Start the
   [host capture tool](usb-log-capture.md) before the test boot.
2. Power on **with USB unplugged**. At `ATTACH USB CABLE NOW`, attach the data
   cable to this Linux PC promptly and leave it connected.
3. Expected success: `US:6 RC:0`, increasing USB IRQs, `USB CONFIGURED`, a host
   ttyACM port and a capture beginning `Y2LOG1 M2-USBACM-01`, followed by retained
   kernel/PID1 messages and increasing beats. A stage5/ready stage alone is not proof.
4. Keep the original **60 seconds from power-on** limit and manual BOOTIMG
   restoration boundary. USB disconnects at the 50s active-window deadline or
   first detach/error; do not reconnect during this initial experiment.
5. Return `out/m2-usbacm-01/capture-01/` and same-boot screen photos if practical,
   near BEAT 10 and late in the window. If USB fails, photograph the complete
   screen including US/RC/IRQ/D, CHR/PW/CLK, LAST ERR and bottom raw/wake rows.
   Note cable timing and any freeze/reset; do not extend the test window.

Retained untested diagnostic fallback: [M2-USBGUARD-01](m2-usbguard-01-result.md).
Its connected-start test is optional follow-up evidence, not required before
this unplugged-start attempt. The hardware-tested CHRDET image remains retained;
its connected-start refusal is documented, not a successful connected wake.

#23/#27/#28 remain open. Physical enumeration, log continuity, late-open/no-reader
and controller reconnect qualification are still outstanding. M1 stays complete;
M2 exit criteria are unchanged, and M3/audio/Y2PlayerNative remain deferred.
