# M2-CHRDET-01 — owner result received

2026-09-09 update: [returned photos](../knowledge/m2-chrdet-hardware-result.md)
confirm successful CHRDET reads in both reported cable-at-startup conditions.
Connected startup returns a guarded PHY refusal (6a=BE, W0), while no-USB
photos show wake success. The next candidate is
[M2-USBGUARD-01](m2-usbguard-01-result.md), exposing the hidden raw guard inputs.
The original offline validation and test instructions below are retained as
the historical handoff; “not tested” no longer describes current status.

2026-09-09, #23/#27 prerequisite under active M2 #28, baseline 305f8f9.
**Offline validated; not flashed or hardware tested.** The previous
[same-boot PHY wake pair](../knowledge/m2-phy-wake-hardware-result.md) confirms
the guarded release and BEAT 10→49 with no reported errors and USB connected.

`e511fb89e45326673183f426a4bdd3b6ca708c25bf3e6ceecfc4a67478aa9660`.

Screen/build **M2-CHRDET-01**, Linux **6.18.0-y2-m2-chrdet1**.
[Exact access contract](../knowledge/m2-chrdet-probe.md).

Adds one PMIC CHR_CON0 read at 0x0000 through the proven bounded PWRAP transport,
after CID/VUSB. Shows the raw value and bit5 charger-presence indication. This
tests the independent PMIC indication while the connected cable still leaves
MAC DEVCTL at 80. It cannot identify a USB host, cable data integrity or voltage.
The guarded PHY 6a release remains unchanged. No added PMIC register, charger,
analog/calibration, VBUS-force, clock, MAC-connection or DMA-control write.

## Validation

- One clean pinned Linux 6.18 / Clang 20.1.8 build, no compiler warnings/errors.
  All 18 selected test methods pass: 26 PWRAP fault/status scenarios, 10 clock,
  37 USB-state, 48 PHY-wake, 22 QEMU ARM PID1 cases and affected artifact,
  BOOTIMG, D08, time32 syscall, framebuffer/text and watchdog checks.
  The new cases cover both status states and third-read completion/ack failures;
  invalid data is visibly unknown and PID1 continues through its bounded loop.
- Linked snapshot c0015208 remains PID1-only/cached, exactly 260 bytes.
  c0015830 supplies address zero; c0015840 calls the read helper after successful
  CID/VUSB. c0015844..54 sets validity only on success. The helper issues the
  read-only AP+9c command then acknowledges AP+a4 only after completion, with
  the two existing 1000-poll/10-us bounds. Existing PHY byte write c0015b90.
- Resolved config differs only in LOCALVERSION; DT, D08, DMA and packaging policy
  unchanged. [Layout](results/m2-chrdet-01-layout.json) and
  [iteration record](results/m2-chrdet-01-iteration.json) pass complete wrapper,
  LK read-tail, current-memory and 16 MiB partition bounds. Gzip 6020 bytes,
  resident kernel [0x80008000,0x8029f5b0), initramfs ends 0x84001784,
  decompressor workspace ends 0x803909f0.
- Build-relevant source hashes match the validated layout. Output retains the
  project snapshot, input lock, ELFs/config/logs, focused linked disassembly and
  artifact hashes. No duplicate build or unchanged source/ROM/recovery audit.

No device operation was executed. Stock preloader/LK, partition tables and
persistent calibration remain protected. M1 stays complete; M2 remains open.

## Owner test

Use the established **BOOTIMG-only procedure**, with the **USB data cable attached
to the Linux PC**, maximum **60 seconds from power-on** and existing manual
restoration boundary. Expected: continued heartbeat to BEAT 50/STOP, usually
`PW:0 /7 CLK:0/15`, `CHR:xxxx D:0` or `D:1`, and the existing wake/trim rows.
Both detection values are useful results, not errors. No ttyACM/enumeration is
expected yet. `CHR:---- D:?` means the read is invalid; retain the exact PWRAP
error/validity and last stage. A guarded PHY refusal remains useful evidence.

Return **two readable full-screen photos from the same boot**, near BEAT 10 and
BEAT 50/STOP, saved in `out/m2-chrdet-01/`. Include the new CHR/PW/CLK row, all
bottom four PHY rows, timer/uptime/MemTotal and LAST ERR. Report whether USB stayed
connected, any freeze/reset, and restoration outcome if performed. If it stalls,
return the last visible stage and approximate elapsed time; do not extend the
existing observation window.

Retained prior candidate: `out/m2-phywake-01/BOOTIMG.img`, SHA-256
`d68c8fbc56721c7aa1fda5b3e321a9aff5876661aac857505864e28d8924793a`.
Stop for this owner test. USB controller ownership/logging and M2 exit are not
claimed; #23/#27/#28 stay open and M3 remains deferred.
