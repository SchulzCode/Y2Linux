# M2-PHYWAKE-01 — ready for owner device test

2026-09-09, active M2 #28, USB prerequisite #27/#23.
**Offline validated; not flashed or hardware tested.** Previous
[USB-state photos](../knowledge/m2-usb-state-hardware-result.md) confirm reads
and BEAT 50 without errors; they identify PHY suspendm forced low.

## Candidate

`/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/m2-phywake-01/BOOTIMG.img`

**1,097,728 bytes**; SHA-256:
`d68c8fbc56721c7aa1fda5b3e321a9aff5876661aac857505864e28d8924793a`.

Screen/build **M2-PHYWAKE-01**, Linux **6.18.0-y2-m2-phywake1**.
[Exact contract](../knowledge/m2-phy-wake-probe.md).

This candidate adds one conditional volatile PHY write: **0x1121086a, 04→00**
to release force_suspendm. It first requires the known supply/clock state,
disconnected B-device MAC, observed HWVERS, zero DMA controls and reviewed PHY
mode controls. A fresh 6a check precedes the write. It then waits 800 us and
records PHY state, calibration-related bytes and MAC POWER/DEVCTL.

No analog trim/calibration, PMIC/clock, VBUS-force, MAC-connection, interrupt or
DMA-control write is added. It does not run the full vendor PHY recovery sequence.
USB enumeration/ttyACM is not expected. A successful force-bit release alone
does not establish a ready PHY, physical VBUS or complete controller contract.

## Validation

- One clean pinned Linux 6.18 / Clang 20.1.8 build, no compiler warnings/errors.
  All 21 top-level test methods and four host-PTY observation methods pass.
  Included production scenarios: 48 PHY wake, 37 USB state, 20 PWRAP, 10 clock,
  plus 20 QEMU ARM PID1 cases. Refusal, read failures, stale force state,
  changed trims, unexpected connection/host state and continued heartbeat are
  covered; fixture outcomes are not physical evidence.
- Emitted cached snapshot is PID1-only and 256 bytes. Release/settle are inlined:
  fresh read c0015b40, comparison with 04 c0015b4c, sole new MMIO byte write
  c0015b64, followed by the correct 800-us const_udelay argument. Seven mode
  reads precede the write; twelve bounded readbacks follow. No retry/rollback.
- Resolved config differs only in LOCALVERSION; DT source is unchanged. D08,
  CPU0, watchdog instructions, framebuffer guard and linked time32 syscall pass.
  No memory/DMA/packaging policy change; no duplicate build or unchanged full
  source/ROM/recovery re-audit.
- [Layout](results/m2-phywake-01-layout.json) and
  [iteration](results/m2-phywake-01-iteration.json) retain dimensions/identity.
  Gzip is 5901 bytes, resident kernel [0x80008000,0x8029f5b0), initramfs ends
  0x8400170d, decompressor workspace ends 0x80390790. Complete BOOTIMG wrappers,
  LK read tail, D08 and 16 MiB partition bounds pass.

Output retains source snapshot, lock, ELFs, config, logs, disassembly and hashes.
No physical Y2 command or flash was executed. Stock preloader/LK, partition
tables and persistent calibration remain protected.

## Owner test and exact evidence

Use the established **BOOTIMG-only procedure, maximum 60 seconds from power-on**.
Expected: first heartbeat, briefly `CHECK PHY / RELEASE SUSPEND`, then continuing
progress to BEAT 50 / `STOP: RESTORE ANDROID`. A bus hang may freeze at the
pre-probe stage; use the existing bounded manual recovery procedure.

Successful release shows:

- `USB RC:0 VALID:001FFFFF`, `PW:0 /3 CLK:0/15`.
- `WAKE:0 W:1 V:7F/FFF`, followed by post-read MAC `P:` and `D:` values.
- `6A:04>00` and seven post-read PHY68..6e bytes, packed as two hex digits each.
- `CTL:` pre-read PHY1a/1d/22/63 values.
- `TRIM:` pre/post pairs for PHY00/05/15; each pair should match.
- Increasing heartbeat/timer counts and `LAST ERR: NONE`.

A refusal can show `WAKE:-19 W:0`; this is useful evidence of an unmet guard,
not permission to force a value. -16 is a stale-force/resource refusal, -12 a
mapping failure, -5 a readback/trim/mode mismatch. W states whether the sole
write occurred. V is before/after validity: 7F means all seven control reads;
FFF means PHY68..6e, trims00/05/15 and POWER/DEVCTL all read back. Zero fields
without validity are not evidence. All observations are cached once per boot.

Return readable full-screen photos near **BEAT 10 and BEAT 50/STOP**, or the
exact last stage on failure. Include all bottom four rows, USB/PW/CLK status,
timer/uptime/MemTotal, mount/sleep status and LAST ERR. Also report selected
image hash (flashed/readback identity if available), host elapsed time, whether
the USB data cable stayed attached to the Linux PC, any reset/freeze and the
usual BOOTIMG-only restoration outcome if performed.

Retained previous candidate: `out/m2-usbstate-01/BOOTIMG.img`, SHA-256
`8c1f701b61a1adb70b1377071e6cb885cda989a422fd75d626cd5c7da5bdb5e7`.
Owner-proven stock/FM restoration and M1 fallback boundaries are unchanged.
Stop here for the physical test. #23/#27/#28 stay open; M3 remains deferred.
