# Storage06 internal boot and owner SSH — accepted on hardware

The owner flashed the single corrected Storage06 BOOTIMG, then the corrected
initial Y2DATA image. SSH now authenticates with the existing
`~/.ssh/y2linux_ed25519` identity. Internal Y2ROOT and Y2DATA mount read-write
without an SD block device. No further flash is needed for this fix.
[Authenticated physical evidence](../hardware-evidence/2026-09-13-storage06-owner/ssh-result.json)
and [retained data-package checks](evidence/y2linux-production-v1-r6-owner-key/README.md).

## Root cause and production correction

The production eMMC port omitted the stock logical disk translation. Linux
sector 0 was reading the reserved native prefix instead of the intact MBR.
The actual stock driver adds 23552 sectors and exposes a 15203328-sector disk.
Storage06 restores that mapping once for CMD17/18/24/25, leaves EXT_CSD and
companion command arguments intact, and keeps writes limited to the original
ANDROID/USRDATA spans. Upstream Linux parses the existing MTK tables; no table,
DT, hardware clock or memory change was needed. See the
[source and stock-binary proof](../knowledge/storage06-addressing-correction.md).

The original data template separately authorized a public key whose private
counterpart was missing. The corrected seed uses the owner's existing `.pub`
file exactly. No client identity was generated, inspected or copied. Normal
production packaging now defaults to that existing public file and validates
the authorization inside the completed Y2DATA filesystem before publication.
`/root/.ssh` resolves into persistent Y2DATA; BOOTIMG/Y2ROOT updates preserve it.

All paths below are relative to the repository root.

Kernel source: `bea30cd5883f524a252d8b94d7e914d9d2f7cbdb`.
Owner-key packaging source: `dcb7f45fd7fbe0adffc10195239f8df934491c8b`.
The root filesystem retains its Storage04 build metadata; the running kernel
and its BOOTIMG-owned modules are Storage06. The independent component contract
permits this unchanged userspace reuse.

The BOOTIMG digest above now matches a complete 5193728-byte read through the
running Linux block device. The Y2DATA digest identifies the unused flash seed;
mounted data subsequently changes as the system creates persistent host keys.
The old rescue fallback restores the known rescue/ACM state, not working
internal boot. The original data seed restores its old authorization failure.

## Manual selections used for this correction

Storage repair: SPFT **Download Only**, load
`out/y2linux-production-v1-r6/MT6582_BOOTIMG_only_scatter.txt`, select BOOTIMG only.

Owner-key initialization: SPFT **Download Only**, load
`out/y2linux-production-v1-r6-owner-key/MT6582_Y2DATA_only_scatter.txt`, select
USRDATA → `Y2DATA.img` only. BOOTIMG, ANDROID and every other row stay unchecked.
Never select Format or Firmware Upgrade. This initialization replaces Y2DATA,
including its initial state and generated server host keys; the owner confirmed
there were no saved files or settings to retain. It is not a normal system update.

Both manual flashes have now been reported complete. MBR/EBR1/EBR2 remain
byte-identical to the stock fixtures through Linux reads. Y2ROOT is p5 at
166912 + 1679360 sectors; Y2DATA is p7 at 2104320 + 1638400 sectors.

## Physical acceptance

The completed test is a boot with no SD block device followed by:

```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/y2linux_ed25519 root@10.42.0.1
```

Authenticated read-only commands confirm Linux 6.18.0-y2linux-storage06, both
internal ext4 mounts, exact geometry/UUIDs, four CPUs, 954376 KiB RAM and USB ECM
10.42.0.1/24. The public file in live Y2DATA has SHA256
`bf9cc937fb5dcee8569514b674fb9b3d5ba25396162efac7e8854f88bfe98c25`, matching
`~/.ssh/y2linux_ed25519.pub` and fingerprint
`SHA256:IS9HhrmQKRtlEEbrcJjZa0XQHVwnRXRUzQQ61/7XAb8`.
The host USB profile is 10.42.0.2/24 with no default route.
The host's obsolete 10.42.0.1 server-key entry was replaced with the public key
verified after initialization; the normal SSH configuration now succeeds too.

54 firmware regressions, ARM shell/ABI checks, BOOTIMG bounds and 13 package
rejection cases passed before the kernel flash. The localized SSH change passed
five focused source tests, ARM filesystem identification, ext4 integrity checks,
exact public-key validation and 11 isolated data-package rejection cases.

Two synthetic ext4 buddy-cache inode warnings remain recorded; filesystem checks
complete cleanly and the system boots. No deliberate physical scratch write,
protected-region write, stress or power-fail test was performed. Those wider
qualification gates and #33 remain open; this pass activates no later subsystem.
