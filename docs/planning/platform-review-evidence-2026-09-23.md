# Whole-platform evidence ledger — 2026-09-23

Companion to [the owner review](../CURRENT_PLATFORM_STATE.md). This is a
documentation-only assessment of application-facing platform behavior, not a
milestone closure, implementation authorization or new physical qualification.

## Scope and evidence authority

Y2Linux source HEAD: `5f6b4468fb43605ca1da679420823afa72cea73f` (clean at entry).
Y2Reborn HEAD: `d9ba0549e6b34eff029bd13f7c33a491fee09e66`; its final commit is
validation documentation. The packaged code is `dde3c537cec66b3b2f70a032584cb054bdb3037e`.
Existing untracked Reborn review/audit documents were read and preserved.

The local candidate `out/y2linux-reborn-correctness-closure-01` exists, with
kernel `6.18.0-y2linux-gpu-02`, Buildroot `2025.02.18`, Reborn `0.1.0`, FFmpeg
`9.0.2`, BlueZ `5.87`, BlueALSA `5.0.0` and SBC `2.2`. Its manifest and generated
kernel configuration were inspected. Its existing hash/test receipts were read;
the images were not rehashed, rebuilt, executed or installed.

The [September 23 closure record][C] reports 143 Reborn tests, 67 + 38 platform
tests, eight ARM/QEMU software checks and package validation passing. Those
results certify their tested software boundaries, not hardware behavior. The
candidate has no retained physical acceptance. Hardware claims below name older
receipts; neither a reused kernel release string nor a passing build transfers
that evidence to all changes in a newer image.

Current GitHub issue state was read: #16/#27/#28/#29/#31/#32/#33/#34 open,
#30 closed. No tracker writes occurred. The [standing audit][R], earlier
[whole-system audit][A] and [subsequent review][V] were read before checking
the current implementations. Historical manifest/version, database-recovery,
SD-pruning and missing Bluetooth-trust findings have subsequent fixes [M], [C]; they
are not repeated here as unfixed platform defects. AVRCP application integration
and R9B's underlying BlueALSA-format verification limit remain separate gaps.

## Evidence matrix

**Implemented** describes the indicated mechanism, not the complete product
promise. **Targeted** host tests exercise selected policies, parsers, mocks or
fault paths. **ARM built** means included in the recorded candidate; QEMU is
userspace emulation, not execution of Y2 peripherals. **Physical** and
**measured** evidence is bounded to the cited build/workload. **None found**
means no qualifying retained endurance result was located; incidental uptime
or owner acceptance is not a repeatable endurance test.

## Boot, storage and application durability

[Production init](../../initramfs/production/init) and
[the resolver](../../initramfs/production/storage.sh) check internal controller,
capacity, partition geometry and ext4 identities, inspect markers read-only,
run fsck, then mount root/data and switch root. Failure paths retain rescue;
there is no automatic format or SD root substitution. This is valuable
containment. It does not establish an end-to-end boot deadline or repair a
post-handoff hung service. Reborn's supervisor retries abnormal **exits** with a
budget; its diagnostic heartbeat watcher does not establish system-wide
hardware-watchdog recovery. Define failure classes, service readiness and
bounded escalation before adding automatic reboot behavior.

The [update architecture](../architecture/update-model.md) explicitly describes
an unimplemented single-slot updater. BOOTIMG and ANDROID are normal package
targets; Y2DATA is preserved. Normal Linux's
[write guard](../../kernel/platform/storage-policy.h) permits root/data writes
and currently **rejects BOOTIMG writes**. OTA kernel installation therefore
needs a separately reviewed rescue writer/guard contract. A torn root can leave
rescue usable; a torn BOOTIMG can remove rescue itself and require external
SPFT. Fallback files, filesystem journaling and hashes do not implement rollback
or authenticity. Prove local staged installation/failure recovery before remote
delivery; Wi-Fi only supplies transport. Include schema rollback compatibility,
backup consistency, staging space, boot-health acknowledgement and key policy.

The [storage layout](../architecture/production-storage-v1.md) provides an
820 MiB root slot (current image 512 MiB) and an 800 MiB data slot. The larger
legacy FAT area is not free staging space. Media, database, cache, logs and OTA
staging compete for the data budget. Do not assume the device's nominal total
flash capacity is application-available capacity.

Both controllers' [DT configuration](../../kernel/dts/innioasis-y2.dts) remains
one bit at 13 MHz; eMMC also has explicit legacy-timing/serialized-request
constraints. The ideal single-data-rate wire ceiling is **13 Mbit/s = 1.625
MB/s before overhead** (a calculation, not a benchmark). This is a plausible
shared bottleneck, not a measured explanation of all startup or scan latency.
Measure sequential and random I/O, file and directory fsync, cache effects and
playback contention before any clock/bus/DMA/filesystem change. The guard permits
specified flush/cache commands; source permission alone does not prove device
cache durability. Erase/trim/sanitize remain rejected. Obtain supported wear
indicators read-only where available; quantify write volume before forecasting
flash life.

[SD mounting](../../buildroot/board/y2/production-overlay/usr/sbin/y2-media)
accepts a unique ext4/vfat filesystem with nosuid/nodev/noexec. There is no
exFAT support or general checked/repair/eject lifecycle. Reborn now checks UUID
and mount generation before pruning [C], but target removal during scan/decode,
blocked unmounts, card replacement, full filesystems and I/O-error recovery
remain unqualified. Preserve prior library data when media disappears.

Reborn's [SQLite boundary](../../../Y2Reborn/crates/reborn-library/src/lib.rs)
uses one writer, WAL, `synchronous=NORMAL`, a two-second busy timeout and startup
`quick_check(10)`. Recent tests distinguish corruption from lock, permission,
I/O and full-disk failures. Its last-query latency gauge is useful but does not
supply percentiles, queue delay or a target benchmark. WAL/NORMAL allows recent
committed transactions to be lost on power failure; application crash recovery
is a different claim. [SQLite's synchronous contract](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous).

The platform must define how much loss is acceptable for rebuildable metadata
and for user state. Reborn's [session writer](../../../Y2Reborn/crates/reborn-core/src/lib.rs)
fsyncs the temporary file, renames it and fsyncs the parent; periodic checkpoints
run at 15 seconds plus explicit events. These mechanisms do not prove the
end-to-end flush path or cap a stalled write's latency. Source limits of 20,000
query/queue items, 250,000 scanned/existing records and an 8 MiB session are
allocation guards, not physically qualified library sizes. Benchmark realistic
schema/data, cold and repeated scans, concurrent playback, WAL checkpoints,
nearly-full storage and restart integrity. Distinguish process interruption
tests from electrical interruption; the latter depends on power/recovery scope.

## CPU, memory and power

The candidate's generated `metadata/kernel.config` confirms `PREEMPT_NONE`,
100 Hz ticks, NO_HZ_IDLE, CPU frequency statistics and HIGHMEM. Normal init
selects schedutil; offline/default policy is powersave. The DT offers
598/747.5/1040 MHz at **fixed 1.15 V**; [cpuidle](../../kernel/platform/idle.c)
offers **WFI only**, not CPU power-down idle. SPM deep suspend is separate.
Existing samples prove operation, not frequency residency, useful idle energy
savings, scheduler latency or an audio deadline. Do not infer a need for RT
scheduling, a new governor or voltage scaling from their mere availability.

The same generated configuration has no PSI, perf events, ftrace, schedstats,
cgroups or swap. Basic proc/sysfs CPU, task, VM, disk and idle/frequency counters
can support an initial baseline. Record absent counters as unavailable; add a
small diagnostic profile only if needed. Reborn's 15 ms main-loop sleep, two-
second service polling, and other background timers are sources to investigate;
their power/wakeup impact has not been measured. Sampling also perturbs idle.

[DEV-02 memory evidence][D] reports **954660 KiB = 932.285 MiB** MemTotal and a
completed 256 MiB allocator test. The larger run stopped at 600 seconds, not a
full pass. Later images have different footprints. Existing exclusions guard
loader/radio/display ownership; capacity pressure is not permission to reclaim
them. Measure lowmem/HIGHMEM separately, process RSS/PSS, slab/page cache,
allocation/reclaim stalls, decoder/artwork/library peaks, OOM behavior and
post-warmup growth. A small GPU utility's RSS is not Reborn's memory budget.

[Thermal acquisition](../../kernel/platform/thermal.c) uses own efuses and
exposes CPU/PMIC die values; earlier invalid readings drove source corrections.
GPU-01's short temperatures are useful relative observations, not externally
calibrated absolute temperatures or battery measurements. Sustained combined
decode/render/scan/radio/charging heat, thermal cooling effectiveness and a
supported ambient envelope remain unknown. Define a measured envelope before
tuning clock or thermal policy.

Charging has substantial [fault-containment implementation](../../kernel/platform/mt6323-charger.c)
and host tests. The driver exposes voltage, presence/status and configured
charge limits, **not measured net current, SOC or battery temperature**. FULL
is a voltage/time policy result. Earlier [70 mA evidence][F] records falling
voltage; later POWER-03 owner acceptance [P] remains valid within its scope.
Commit `3dc0a8b` subsequently changes depleted-battery charging to retain the
450 mA selector on eligible sources. Its
[recorded limitation](../knowledge/m4-charging.md#premium-02-low-voltage-policy-update)
still requires physical evidence. Do not extrapolate older acceptance to it.

[Offline charging](../../tools/production/offline-charge.c) gates normal boot
on voltage and user intent. Reborn's [power adapter](../../../Y2Reborn/crates/reborn-platform/src/power.rs)
reads supplies and requests shutdown; neither it nor the inspected normal
platform services implements a complete low-battery warning/checkpoint/shutdown
policy. This is a missing operational capability, distinct from charger
protection or eventual hardware cutoff. Assign the platform decision/timeout
ownership, provide an application stop/checkpoint handshake and handle missing
sensors, blocked storage and a hung app without requiring the UI to remain alive.
Derive thresholds/reserve from measured pack behavior; this review sets none.

[GPU-01][G] proves runtime domain-off, static-context redraw and renderer
termination recovery. Deep sleep failed and a subsequent staged test exposed
the CPU3 status-bit mismatch. Source correction/host tests do not prove resume.
[Suspend policy](../../buildroot/board/y2/production-overlay/usr/sbin/y2-suspend)
quiesces radios and honors activity leases; active charging is also constrained
by the kernel. Required evidence is the same boot ID/process state after wake,
intended Power/RTC wake reason and restored storage, display, audio, input and
radio services. Measure energy and repeat cycles only within the accepted power
procedure. Screen-off playback is not system suspend.

## Connectivity and USB contracts

[Connectivity orchestration](../../buildroot/board/y2/production-overlay/usr/libexec/y2/connectivity)
starts calibration, supplicant, BlueALSA and reconnect helpers, with selected
child liveness checks. [The WPA event hook](../../buildroot/board/y2/production-overlay/usr/libexec/y2/wpa-event)
starts DHCP and clears addresses on disconnect. Thus complete networking is
partly implemented, not merely a scan stub. However, process existence and
supplicant COMPLETED do not prove route/DNS/secure-download readiness. No retained
WPA association, DHCP/DNS/data or throughput receipt was found. Qualify wrong
credentials, absent AP, DHCP renewal, signal loss, service restart and saved
network reboot; measure time to usable IP/DNS and recovery rather than counting
scan results. RTC/time bootstrap matters for TLS; curl and CA certificates in a
rootfs do not complete this contract.

BlueZ plus BlueALSA/SBC is built. The platform
[preferred-peer helper](../../tools/connectivity/reconnect.c) owns retries;
upstream reconnect attempts are disabled to avoid competing owners. The current
[Reborn adapter](../../../Y2Reborn/crates/reborn-platform/src/bluetooth.rs)
sets trust after user confirmation and invalidates stale transport epochs [M],
[C], superseding the earlier missing-trust finding. Physical evidence remains
adapter power/discovery and short concurrent Wi-Fi scans, not pairing or PCM
delivery. Qualify fresh bonds, peer loss, daemon/bus restarts, SBC transport and
Wi-Fi traffic coexistence. The ALSA plug wrapper still prevents a claim about
the underlying PCM's exact format; optional codecs and AVRCP are separate scope.

USB is explicitly peripheral-only ACM/ECM in PIO mode. The two measured
[POWER-02 reconnects][U] used an `on` runtime-PM workaround. Current
[kernel USB code](../../kernel/platform/usb.c) holds a PM reference across live
sessions and detach/reentry; that correction already exists. The old userspace
pin is release-specific and does not apply to GPU-02. Current repeated reconnect
under automatic runtime PM still needs proof; do not propose the already-present
reference fix as new work. Throughput, idle draw, charger/cable changes and
suspend interactions need measurement. Host/OTG is disabled in both config and
DT; SoC capability alone does not prove board VBUS sourcing or role wiring.

## Diagnostics, security and maintainability

Useful pieces already exist: [platform inventory](../../buildroot/board/y2/overlay/usr/sbin/y2-collect),
[bounded GPU telemetry](../../tools/graphics/collect.sh), charging/USB observers,
ACM capture, two 256 KiB persistent syslog files, and Reborn's bounded metrics,
events, diagnostics and restart budget. Preserve them and establish a shared
record format: host date + boot/monotonic time, source/image identity, units,
counter-versus-gauge semantics, workload, collection cost and failures.
Application/library names, SSIDs and identifiers need controlled export.
Persistent logs need wear/free-space budgets; logs on failing storage cannot be
the only recovery evidence.

There is no qualified persistent early-crash/reset-cause path. Physical UART
remains unresolved; GPU-01 lost continuation logs across a failed suspend.
`panic=0` and an exit supervisor are not a system hang-recovery policy. The
AP/system watchdog must be distinguished from the implemented charger watchdog.
Define retention, reset cause and recovery escalation without introducing a
reboot loop. Also correct the demonstrably stale
[`y2-status power`](../../tools/production/y2-status) message: it contradicts
the implemented charger. Versioned software capability, service readiness and
physically qualified behavior should be separately visible.

Key-only Dropbear binds the USB address; persistent keys/bonds/configuration
have private directories, and packages exclude private SSH keys. These are
useful security properties. Reborn and its native media/graphics dependencies
still run as root. The candidate kernel disables seccomp, LSM security,
stack protector and cgroups; rootfs remains writable. This is a development
posture, not a sandboxed consumer service. Define the threat model and necessary
privileged operations before selecting a small privilege/hardening boundary.
Do not expose additional network debugging merely because Wi-Fi becomes usable.
Define first-owner provisioning, time/entropy readiness and diagnostic access.

[Input locks](../../buildroot/inputs.lock.json), exact kernel overlay hashes,
[device-isolated kernel builds](../../tools/build/run.py), vendored Rust and
corrected per-payload identities are strong foundations. Historical
[M1 duplicate builds](../build/results/m1-reproducibility.json) matched exactly.
The current complete production release has no retained independent clean-host
two-build comparison. Buildroot/native steps also use host tools, and the paired
Reborn checkout/toolchain/owner inputs need a complete acquisition recipe.
Checksums establish identity, not update authenticity. Preserve selected
[production test profiles](../../tests/README.md); automate them and archive
release receipts without confusing historical suites with current passes.
Maintain the version-specific Buildroot overrides and board patches with clear
owners, a kernel/userspace security-update cadence and a dependency/source/license
inventory. Firmware redistribution remains unestablished in the manifest; this
owner-local candidate is not a completed public distribution package.

## Measured facts and qualification limits

| Retained fact | Scope and limit |
| --- | --- |
| Storage06 root handoff **8.728982 s** [S] | One internal boot; not a distribution or latest boot-time promise |
| Later root handoff **12.246 s**, first frame **52.060 s** [L] | Older installed Reborn audio build; startup source improvements lack a retained physical retiming |
| GPU workload **120.009 s**, **30.00 FPS**, presentation p95 **16.191 ms** [G] | Bounded graphics utility, not application responsiveness under storage load |
| Utility **3.36% of one CPU**, maximum RSS **13076 KiB** [G] | Not system CPU use, current Reborn RSS or battery energy |
| CPU **46.8–49.6°C**, PMIC **46.298–48.637°C** [G] | Short die-temperature trace, no GPU/pack sensor or steady-state/ambient qualification |
| DEV-02 **954660 KiB** MemTotal and short **256 MiB** allocator pass [D] | Earlier image; longer suite capped at 600 s |
| Reborn Wi-Fi scan **28 networks / 5.129 s including SSH** [B] | No AP association, IP/DNS or throughput measurement |
| Bluetooth discovery **0 peers / 11.261 s including SSH** [B] | Successful scan completion, no peer interoperability evidence |
| Two POWER-02 same-boot USB reconnects [U] | Historical workaround; not current automatic-PM endurance |
| 70 mA baseline fell **39.990 mV over 1015.808 s** [F] | Historical adverse evidence; not calibrated current and not a test of the later policy |

No retained eMMC/SD MB/s or IOPS baseline, fsync latency distribution,
representative SQLite timing, CPU-frequency/idle residency report, current
Reborn RSS trajectory, Wi-Fi throughput/reconnect series, calibrated battery
runtime/energy series or integrated endurance pass was found in the reviewed
receipts. Existing counters/tools are not substitutes for recorded results.

For future qualification, start with bounded attended scenarios, then repeat
on the same reference image. Freeze workload sizes and acceptance budgets after
measurement. A proposed final 24-hour mixed workload should require no
unexplained reset, corruption or normal-playback underrun, stable memory after
warmup, and bounded documented recovery from expected injected failures.
Repeat boot/reconnect/suspend and update-interruption scenarios only after their
prerequisites; a long idle uptime alone is insufficient. Keep normal operation,
failure injection and wear testing as explicitly identified workload classes.
No tests, benchmarks, device commands or unchanged provenance checks were
executed for this review.
