# Y2 CPU idle completion physical qualification

## Candidate02 hardware qualification — 2026-10-03

**C1 WORKING; C2 WORKING; C3 BLOCKED BEFORE ENTRY BY UART1. Overall CPU idle
qualification FAILS.** The owner flashed candidate02 and authorized these tests.
The installed SPI0 correction is observed: SPI0 is quiet and released. UART1
still prevents dormant admission. No physical C3 call, context loss, forced gate,
reboot, flashing or push occurred. This section supersedes candidate02 NOT_RUN
and owner-flash instructions in the historical sections below.

Private raw evidence: `out/cpu-idle-completion-physical/20261003T144857Z-candidate02/`.
SSH receipts retain host UTC, installed source identity, boot ID, command,
stdout/stderr and exit status. `qualification/result.json` is the full harness
result; `settled-preflight-result.json` isolates the remaining C3 blocker;
`final-snapshot.json` and `final-verdict.json` record the restored device.

### Exact installed identity

All candidate manifest axes, running kernel and Reborn build match:

| Axis | Installed value |
| --- | --- |
| Kernel | `6.18.0-y2linux-cpu-idle-02` |
| Linux source | `db0234e7519c559031da6f427869ab683ffe0f3c` |
| Reborn source | `b71b468860233faa0a42b8448ec5777fa952b8e3` |
| Rootfs | `2025.02.18-platform-v1.19` |
| Release / build | `1.0.0-cpu-idle-completion-candidate.2` / `Y2LINUX-CPU-IDLE-COMPLETION-02` |
| Boot ID throughout | `f155196b-64d4-45a4-88b3-27755a1a8926` |

Source checkout HEAD at admission was `76567e5`, a later documentation commit;
it is not the installed kernel source. Reborn remains unchanged. Cmdline is
`rdinit=/init earlycon console=ttyS0,921600n8 console=tty0 loglevel=3 panic=0 log_buf_len=1M user_debug=31`.
Package `out/y2linux-cpu-idle-completion-02-candidate/` is unchanged. Fresh hashes:

| Payload | Bytes | SHA256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| BOOTIMG.img | 7213056 | `aa371ce343801c41b0908aa85f7c11d7ae6de91cbbe93420ce1f7d29a5b0caa2` |
| Y2ROOT.img | 536870912 | `54b799fbcd6c85ef4b61c4210e68e1ee19efa8e6079fd2c96bf238e16d728f15` |

### C1, natural parking and useful C2 residency

All four WFI states are enabled; entries and residency advance with no rejection.
Wake observations are elapsed times for requested 1ms sleeps, not direct silicon
exit-latency measurements. Each core completes 100 bounded sleeps.

| CPU | Additional WFI entries | Residency, us | Rejections | Median / p95 wake, ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 725 | 12170037 | 0 | 1.084885 / 1.104192 |
| 1 | 923 | 12210872 | 0 | 1.084423 / 1.116499 |
| 2 | 1695 | 11737138 | 0 | 1.085116 / 1.090577 |
| 3 | 669 | 12282932 | 0 | 1.085578 / 1.139421 |

Maximum sampled wake1.522331ms; MONOTONIC/RAW drift−410237ns in12.076045s.
C1 needs no redesign. Three Linux hotplug cycles pass all18 transitions,
CPU3→2→1 off and1→2→3 on, with exact secondary bits checked in both SPM power
copies. Natural coordinator parking reaches CPU0/owner0xe after141.129531s.
Ten-second observer sampling does not time every intermediate automatic step;
the existing one-core policy and physical hotplug checks remain intact. Screen
and real playback demand restore all four cores, with no ownership error.

With screen off, radios runtime-off and natural CPU0-only topology, SLIDLE adds
**6,772 entries and50,669,913us in60.048084272s: 84.38% C2 residency**.
SLIDLE failures0, brokenN, exact clock restore failures0, bus rejections0;
the final single-core blocker mask is0. CPU0 WFI also adds3.858558s in the metrics
window. Pre/post clock, bus, timer, MMC, IRQ, CPU and coordinator snapshots are
retained. APDMA bit11/BTIF bit20 legitimately block when Wi-Fi is active; MSDC
bits12/13 appear during actual I/O. No blocker mask is weakened.

| Window | Seconds | CPU utilization | CPUs | CPU0 WFI, s | C2, s | IRQ/s | Context switches/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen on idle | 20.062027 | 3.66% | 0–3 | 19.416767 | 0 | 445.82 | 511.02 |
| Screen off before parking | 20.077351 | 2.89% | 0–3 | 19.567692 | 0 | 352.89 | 399.46 |
| Screen off, parked, C2 enabled | 60.048084 | 8.04% | 0 | 3.858558 | 50.669913 | 184.84 | 340.11 |

C2-window MONOTONIC/RAW drift−694347ns; ending temperatures39.865/40.4°C.
CPU utilization is aggregated over online cores. There is no electrical
measurement or battery-life claim. The earlier baseline enabled/disabled
comparison remains separate evidence; it was not repeated in this run.

### C3: initial topology race, then exact settled preflight

The full harness initially rejects topology, secondary power and UART1 clocks:
fsynced storage work has correctly restored four cores after the C2 window.
This exposes a harness sequencing defect, not failed Linux hotplug. The device
helper now waits again for normal CPU0-only parking, owner0xe, both physical
secondary power copies clear and20s stability after sync/USB detach. It never
forces topology or arms C3 while waiting. Durable progress saves are limited to
once per60s to reduce observer I/O; timeout/boot change fail safely. New guard
tests cover ownership, both power copies, timeout and reset. The supplementary
physical run demonstrates the same settled topology rule; the edited complete
harness was not rerun because UART1 still blocks entry.

The settled run uses only supported owners: screen off, no workload, radios
runtime-off, USB role none,747.5MHz and natural parking. C3 stays disabled;
budget1 and the10s RGU backstop are armed only to expose read-only preflight,
then cleared. Results:

| Prerequisite | Settled physical result |
| --- | --- |
| CPU topology / secondary power / domains | CPU0 only, owner0xe; both power copies0x314c; secondary/domain masks0 |
| Frequency / screen / workload | 747500kHz; screen off; no disallowed lease |
| System / boot policy / SPM / broken state | All report ready; no broken latch |
| Local events / CIRQ / context availability | All report ready; actual deep restore unexercised |
| Runtime budget / qualification backstop / USB restore owner | All report ready in bounded preflight; cleared/restored afterward |
| INFRA / display / bus clocks | All blocker masks0 |
| PERI clocks | **0x00020000: UART1 bit17; clocks prerequisite fails** |
| Runtime PCM | Exact MT6582 d53dd75c DPIDLE PCM,480words |
| Resume/context diagnostics | Vector0x80012000, expected0x804833c0, enable0x80000000; stash0x81433140, context_last0; actual programming not exercised |
| Architectural/GPT4 deadline | Future >2ms /26000ticks at13MHz rule present; dynamic admission/finisher not exercised |

Every exposed static prerequisite except clocks passes. `unmet=clocks,`.
Installed handoff diagnostics show UART1 LCR/IER/LSR/DMA0,
`reason=tx_not_drained retained=1`; UART2/3 LSR0x60 release, SPI0
COMMAND0/STATUS1=1 quiet/released. Rechecks advance without CCF failures.

**Dormant attempts, entries, resumes, successes and residency all remain0.**
CIRQ entry/replay, GPT4 dormant handoff and local timer context save/restore are
unexercised. Thus CPU0 context loss/return, GIC/MMU/VFP/cache/coherency restore,
near-boundary deadline trials and20 repeated wake cycles are not qualified.
C3 stays off. This is neither a C3 success nor proof of an exact hardware limit.

### Targeted UART1 evidence; no unsafe clock forcing

Two temporary diagnostic modules are built for the exact installed ARM kernel,
with actual-function native guard/failure tests under UBSAN (8+11 cases pass).
They use the fixed source-pinned MT6582 windows and normal balanced CCF borrow/
release, require UART1 already clocked, and skip live/unknown/aliased states.
Both return EAGAIN after cleanup, so expected `insmod` exit1 leaves no resident
module. No userspace MMIO or UART FIFO/data/baud/IRQ/DMA/GPIO/reset writes occur.

The read-only snapshot reports PERI reset0/0, UART sleep0, FCR_RD0, ACTIVE_EN0,
IRQ/DMA0 and LSR0. It excludes a held PERI reset/enabled sleep-control explanation;
these names/default-like values do not prove transmitter idle. A second bounded
transaction follows the exact MT6582 BSP divisor-save sequence, temporarily
selecting LCR.DLAB0x80, reading DLL1/DLH0, then restoring LCR0 and verifying it.
It requires CPU0, all four cores, coordinator disabled and both radio power
copies off. Its first invocation safely skips a still-active radio power domain;
the settled invocation succeeds with gates unchanged. LSR remains0. The UART
has a nonzero divisor; no source-backed proof justifies accepting LSR0 or gating
this retained engine. The production guard is preserved.

Exact sources: [MT6582 UART definitions](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/drivers/misc/mediatek/uart/mt6582/platform_uart.h),
[platform UART](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/drivers/misc/mediatek/uart/mt6582/platform_uart.c),
[common UART save/baud code](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/drivers/misc/mediatek/uart/uart.c).
Pinned local vendor/retained Y2 provenance remains in the source record. Register
inferences are restricted to exact MT6582 evidence; no adjacent-SoC transplant.

The main qualification and settled preflight ran at taint0. Diagnostic module
loading then truthfully sets out-of-tree flag4096, which remains until a normal
owner reboot; it is not hidden or cleared. Final evidence records that expected
flag, no resident probes, no new critical kernel errors and the same boot.

### Independent regressions, software checks and final state

Both eMMC11230000.mmc and inserted SD11240000.mmc pass16 fsynced uncached128KiB
SHA256 rounds per medium, split before/after the **failed C3 preflight**, not a
dormant wake. Ext4 errors remain0 on rootmmcblk0p7, datammcblk0p5 and SDmmcblk1p1;
MMC errors/mismatches0. Final clocks gated on both hosts; retained context
advances (eMMC633/632 suspends/resumes, SD4149/4148). No live-media reset, CRC,
timeout or DMA corruption observed. SD absent is not physically tested.

All five OPPs pass before and after preflight:598/747.5/1040MHz at1.15V,
1196MHz at1.20V and1300MHz at1.25V. PWRAP readiness/readback and thermal authority
pass; no lowered ceiling. GPT6 free-running13MHz, GPT4 sole broadcast, PPI29,
all four CNTFRQ13MHz, highres/NO_HZ and bounded timer continuity pass with per-core
timer errors0. None of these observations proves dormant timer restoration.

Real Reborn/FFmpeg/ALSA silent playback adds352256 decoded frames, with errors,
xruns and recoveries unchanged0; PlaybackNormal demand restores all cores.
Screen restore passes through normal Reborn/DRM ownership. Three bidirectional
1MiB USB rounds match host/device SHA256; the pinned independent Wi-Fi observer
responds on the same boot. Actual transport failover, radio throughput/endurance,
manual button edges, full-system suspend and electrical battery benefit are
unobserved. Independent phase results pass; overall CPU idle acceptance fails C3.

Fresh locked-host checks:90 CPU tests,8 slow-idle/suspend-policy tests and2
workload QoS tests pass; the dedicated harness/completion21 host cases also
pass. The prior sealed
kernel/root/config/DT/ABI/package validation stays valid: no production kernel
or rootfs source change is made this turn. Changed tracked files are the device
helper/tests and validation/release/roadmap records. No empty replacement image.

Final C3disable1, budget0, RGU disarmed; coordinatorY, schedutil598000–1300000,
USB device, Wi-Fi on/Bluetooth off and original screen-off policy restored.
Temporary observer/probe files and modules are absent; cleanup errors0. Playback
is stopped. Its original paused selection was an already deleted historical
qualification fixture, so it cannot be resumed through the normal owner API;
the invalid preexisting selection is recorded, not silently replaced by music.
Y2DATA and protected partitions remain intact. Issues#16/#27/#28/#29/#31/#32/
#33/#34 stay OPEN; no release milestone is closed.

**Next boundary:** resolve UART1 ownership with exact source/hardware evidence
before another guarded C3 entry. There is no newly built image to flash, no
request to reflash candidate02 and no safe supported live control that proves
this retained UART can be gated. C1/C2 remain usable; C3 remains disabled.

## Candidate01 hardware qualification — 2026-10-03

**C1 WORKING; C2 WORKING; C3 BLOCKED BEFORE PHYSICAL ENTRY.** The owner installed
the sealed images and authorized this hardware run. The automated overall
qualification **FAILS** because C3 cannot pass its real clock prerequisites.
Independent regressions completed; no reset, corruption or forced entry occurred.
Earlier baseline results below are historical and do not substitute for this run.

Private evidence: `out/cpu-idle-completion-physical/20261003T130848Z-candidate/`.
Admission, source/boot-tagged SSH command/stdout/stderr/exit receipts, durable
qualification job and result, post-run state and summary are retained. Installed
identity matches every candidate axis: Linux
`3dfb5f5cc731ec5dac88a778290819c23dba6067`, Reborn
`b71b468860233faa0a42b8448ec5777fa952b8e3`, kernel
`6.18.0-y2linux-cpu-idle-01`, root `2025.02.18-platform-v1.18`, release
`1.0.0-cpu-idle-completion-candidate.1`, build
`Y2LINUX-CPU-IDLE-COMPLETION-01`. Boot
`e0eb2f36-7c1f-4007-99e2-81d2eae047d4` stays unchanged; taint0 throughout.

### C1, parking and C2

All four WFI states are present and enabled. During the bounded qualification:

| CPU | Additional entries | Residency, us | Rejections | Median / p95 wake, ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1271 | 11972491 | 0 | 1.083999 / 1.095614 |
| 1 | 1050 | 12207881 | 0 | 1.084691 / 1.110306 |
| 2 | 990 | 12337826 | 0 | 1.084306 / 1.093922 |
| 3 | 612 | 12244397 | 0 | 1.084306 / 1.091383 |

Maximum sampled1ms wake1.706998ms; MONOTONIC/RAW drift-9575ns in12.068182s.
Three supported hotplug cycles pass all18 transitions and both physical power
copies, CPU3→2→1 off and1→2→3 on. Automatic parking subsequently honors its
pressure hold: first CPU3 parked at252s, CPU0/owner0xe at262s. Ten-second observer
sampling does not individually time CPU2/CPU1; supported hotplug/source tests
prove their exact physical bits and one-core policy. Screen wake and real
PlaybackNormal demand restore all four cores without ownership errors.

Screen off and radios runtime-off make C2 naturally eligible. SLIDLE adds
**7,040 entries and49,674,049us in60.047964546s (82.72%)**, with WFI4.061876s.
SLIDLE failures0, bus rejections0, clock restore failures0, final blocker0 in
this window. Active APDMA/BTIF are legitimate blockers when Wi-Fi returns;
MMC request blockers appear during real I/O and disappear afterward.

| Window | Seconds | CPU utilization | CPUs | CPU0 WFI, s | CPU0 C2, s | IRQ/s | Context switches/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen on idle | 20.076549 | 3.58% | 0–3 | 18.649760 | 0 | 452.82 | 529.22 |
| Screen off before parking | 20.070139 | 3.41% | 0–3 | 19.450031 | 0 | 351.67 | 403.19 |
| Screen off, parked, C2 enabled | 60.047965 | 9.47% | 0 | 4.061876 | 49.674049 | 187.72 | 343.06 |

C2-window MONOTONIC/RAW drift218003ns. CPU utilization is aggregated over online
cores; this is not an electrical comparison. Temperatures stay below the
75°C test guard (observed CPU about38–44.7°C). No measured battery-life claim.

### C3 preflight failure and exact remaining owners

Normal controls stop playback, turn radios runtime-off, detach USB through its
role owner, cap747.5MHz, use automatic CPU0-only topology and arm the existing
10s RGU backstop with budget1. Preflight then reports:

- Power copies0x314c/0x314c; secondary mask0, blocked domains0.
- PERI blockers**0x02020000 = UART1 bit17 + SPI0 bit25**.
- INFRA blockers0, DISP0/1 blockers0, bus0.
- Every other exposed static prerequisite category passes; only clocks fails.
- Runtime PCM480words, originMT6582_d53dd75c_dpidle; CIRQ ready and inactive.
- Dynamic architectural/GPT4 deadline and actual context/vector programming
  were not exercised: no actual dormant call was admitted.

Boot warnings identify both as retained active/unknown loader engines. CCF
summary shows zero enable/prepare references and no consumer for both. Only
UART0 at0x11002000 is Linux's serial owner; UART1's sampled window is0x11003000,
SPI0's0x1100a000. Installed diagnostics do not expose the boot-time raw operands,
so the exact UART busy field and observed SPI status value remain **unknown**.
No userspace MMIO, register forcing, driver reset, guard bypass or fake counter.

SPM dormant attempts/entries/resumes/successes/residency remain0. CIRQ entries/
flushes and local timer context saves/restores remain0; no error in those counters
is proof of dormant restoration. Near-boundary and20-cycle trials correctly do
not run after failed preflight. C3 remains disabled, budget0, backstop disarmed.
This is a software/clock ownership gap, **not evidence of a hardware limit**.

Source follow-up corrects the SPI predicate that treats the vendor's nonzero
idle indication as busy, distinguishes UART timeout metadata from real DMA,
retains error/unknown/aliased UART states, and adds boot-time read-only operands
and reason names. See [the source record](Y2-CPU-IDLE-COMPLETION.md). A follow-up
candidate must physically prove these decisions before any C3 success claim.

### Independent regressions and restored state

Both eMMC and inserted SD pass8 fsynced, uncached128KiB SHA256 rounds in each
storage phase (16 per medium total). Ext4 errors remain0 for current root/data
`mmcblk0p7`/`mmcblk0p5` and SD`mmcblk1p1`; driver errors/mismatches0. Runtime
suspend/resume/retained-context counts advance and clocks gate afterward. SD
absent is not observed. No mounted media reset or calibration access.

Both OPP sweeps reach598/747.5/1040MHz at1.15V,1196MHz at1.20V,1300MHz at1.25V,
with original schedutil598000–1300000 policy restored. The second sweep follows
C3 **preflight**, not dormant wake. GPT6 free-running13MHz, GPT4 sole broadcast,
architectural PPI29/highres/NO_HZ and all four CNTFRQ readbacks remain intact;
per-core timer errors0 and bounded continuity pass. Actual dormant timer handoff
and CIRQ/GIC/MMU/VFP/cache restoration remain unobserved.

The real Reborn/FFmpeg/ALSA silent44.1kHz stereo test adds356,352 decoded frames,
with decode/filter/playback errors0 and xruns0. Screen restore/all-core demand
wake pass. Three1MiB USB bidirectional transfers match SHA256 on host/device;
the separately pinned Wi-Fi observer responds on the same boot. Automatic
USB→Wi-Fi fallback was not required during sparse polls; both may intentionally
be unavailable while legitimate radio-off/USB detach controls run locally.

Finally screen off/Wi-Fi online/Bluetooth off/coordinator enabled/original DVFS
and USB role are restored. Temporary test files and owned Wi-Fi listener are
removed. The initial paused selection referred to an already deleted historical
qualification fixture (track414), so it cannot safely be resumed; playback is
left stopped. No new filesystem/IRQ fault, same boot, taint0. Full-system suspend
is excluded because its historic resume failure remains a separate gate.
No flash or push occurred.

## Historical installed baseline qualification

The previous installed baseline was qualified on 2026-10-03. Private raw evidence:
`out/cpu-idle-completion-physical/20261003T074026Z/`. Every SSH receipt includes
host UTC time, exact command, output, exit code, compiled source identities and
boot identity. The automated candidate qualification is a separate run after
owner flash; no candidate hardware result is claimed here.

Installed Linux `131ee4621cd583c955182f994adac5a594fb823f`, Reborn
`7f9df397ab3809d52e2f1073ca93a305246e0c3a`, kernel
`6.18.0-y2linux-baseline-01`, root `2025.02.18-platform-v1.17`, release
`1.0.0-baseline-candidate.1`, boot `cee326c1-a5b0-447a-8eb0-dc3f39f7e2c2`,
taint0. Runtime identity matches the sealed baseline BOOTIMG/Y2ROOT metadata,
rather than being inferred from repository HEAD. The authorized USB SSH path
was used, with a same-boot Wi-Fi observer verified before radio-off testing.

## C1: WORKING

Receipt `04-c1-all-cores`: all four CPUs online through the supported coordinator
control, 100 one-millisecond sleeps pinned to each CPU, then a bounded 12-second
idle window. Original coordinator policy was restored in finally.

| CPU | New WFI entries | New residency, us | New rejections | Median / p95 wake, ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1123 | 12028655 | 0 | 1.071535 / 1.290226 |
| 1 | 916 | 12137106 | 0 | 1.082920 / 1.096997 |
| 2 | 649 | 12236436 | 0 | 1.087458 / 1.091458 |
| 3 | 1214 | 11744082 | 0 | 1.087227 / 1.095612 |

MONOTONIC versus MONOTONIC_RAW difference changed -39154 ns. Same boot, taint0,
all cores returned. C1 architecture is frozen.

## C2: WORKING

Receipts `07`/`08` first establish legitimate APDMA/BTIF blockers with Wi-Fi on,
and no such blockers with radios off. An initial 60-second observation did not
produce C2 while the coordinator was honoring a four-minute pressure hold.
That is a policy hold, not evidence of broken MMC clock gating.

Receipts `09`/`10` allow the existing policy to settle without bypassing its
hysteresis. A radio restore/start-up burst escalated the hold to 480000 ms.
Thirty-second observations show CPU3 parked at `settle-16` and CPU2/CPU1 parked
by `settle-17`. Final owner mask0xe, CPU0 only, quiet139040 ms, sustained load129
millicores and high-frequency residency148 per mille. No manual offline was
used to make this C2 window eligible.

During the 60.404075502-second CPU0-only, screen-off/radios-off window:

- SLIDLE entries2657 ->9839: **+7182**.
- SLIDLE residency18394631 ->69158372 us: **+50763741 us**, or50.763741 seconds,
  approximately84.0% of wall time.
- CPU0 WFI entries+1584, residency+3901404 us; DORMANT entries0.
- SLIDLE failures0, clock restore failures0, brokenN, bus rejection0.
- SLIDLE clock blockers0; both MMC controllers gated before and after.
- CPU utilization8.5795%, IRQ168.250/s, context switches338.785/s.
- MONOTONIC versus MONOTONIC_RAW difference changed -64809 ns.

The clock transaction restores the exact inherited bus configuration; no bit
was removed from a blocker mask. The source change from Fix03 is present in the
baseline and physically resolves the historical reset-default bus rejection.
Preserve it rather than redesigning working C2 or storage.

## Storage after C2

Both eMMC and inserted SD were mounted and usable. In each of the two radio-off
runs, eight fsynced, uncached SHA256 readback cycles per medium passed. Temporary
random test files were removed. `mmcblk1p7`, `mmcblk1p5`, `mmcblk0p1` ext4 error
counts remained0. Runtime suspend/resume and retained-context counters advanced
on both controllers, with mismatches0/errors0 and both clocks gated afterward.
Request refusal counts increased during real I/O, as required; DMA/controller/
FIFO/IRQ busy refusals remained0. No reset of mounted media was attempted.
SD-absent operation is **not observed**: physical card removal requires the
owner. The post-flash harness records whichever media are actually present.

## Hotplug, DVFS and timers

Receipt `11-hotplug-opps`: three complete supported hotplug cycles, offline
CPU3 ->CPU2 ->CPU1 and restore CPU1 ->CPU2 ->CPU3, 18 transitions total. SPM power
copies were captured at each step, proving physical secondary power-off rather
than only scheduler exclusion. All CPUs then passed pinned one-millisecond
sleeps (median about1.084 ms, maximum p95 about1.111 ms).

All five guarded OPPs were actually reached under bounded min=max policy:
598000,747500,1040000 kHz at1150000 uV;1196000 at1200000 uV;1300000 at1250000 uV.
Voltage faultN, PWRAP request/readback error0. Original limits, schedutil and
coordinator policy were restored. CPU temperature44–45.1 C, PMIC42.204–42.789 C.
Same boot, ext4 counts0.

GPT6 free-running13 MHz, GPT4 broadcast, architectural physical timers/PPI29,
high-resolution timers and NO_HZ are observed in initial raw state and bounded
continuity receipts. No timer foundation was replaced.

## C3: SOFTWARE_READY_NEEDS_NEW_FLASH

The installed baseline has C3 registered but default disabled and never
physically entered. It was not forced past current live prerequisites. Live
preflight identifies frequency, powered radios, active/inherited display and
peripheral clocks; the old unconditional DISP-power predicate additionally
contradicts the exact MT6582 vendor clock-based condition. Screen-off currently
blanks the backlight but keeps DRM scanout running.

Source fixes, candidate artifacts and the next qualification command are
recorded in [the implementation record](Y2-CPU-IDLE-COMPLETION.md). This label
is the software handoff category, not a claim of a successful DORMANT entry.
Receipt12 additionally proves a USB0 clock ownership leak: normal role none
changes MUSB active ->suspended, but PERI bit10 stays active; restoring device
returns MUSB active on the same boot. No unsafe MMIO interface was used.

The new candidate must verify one bounded real CPU reset/resume, then at least
20 bounded cycles with unchanged boot identity, timer/IRQ/context continuity,
restore counters, storage and interactive workload regressions. A failed first
attempt quarantines C3; it is not automatically hammered again.

No electrical energy measurement was made. Residency is demonstrated; battery
life improvement is not claimed. No flash or push occurred.

## Playback and demand wake

Receipt16 creates, scans and plays a temporary silent44.1-kHz stereo WAV through
the actual Reborn/FFmpeg/ALSA pipeline. Eight seconds add352256 decoded frames;
xruns, recoveries and playback errors add0. All cores online, a real
PlaybackNormal lease active. Playback stopped and the fixture removed/rescanned.
Receipt14 found no old retained fixtures and is explicitly not a playback pass.

Receipts17/18: normal Reborn screen-on/off transitions return on the same boot;
three bidirectional1MiB USB SHA256 rounds pass with independent Wi-Fi SSH ready.
These awake results do not qualify the candidate's new bus-clock gate yet.

## Controlled residency comparison

Receipt21 completes a device-side comparison without host polling during each
window; initial screen/radio/C2 policy restored in finally, same boot, taint0.
No C3 control was changed. Frequency residency and temperatures are retained
alongside each raw before/after snapshot.

| Condition | Wall seconds | CPU utilization | Online CPUs | CPU0 WFI, s | CPU0 SLIDLE entries / seconds | IRQ/s | Context switches/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Screen on idle | 20.083 | 4.25% | 0–3 | 19.084 | 0 / 0 | 444.75 | 518.34 |
| Screen off before parking | 20.070 | 3.08% | 0–3 | 19.500 | 0 / 0 | 315.69 | 397.46 |
| Parked, C2 enabled | 30.062 | 9.39% | 0 | 1.942 | 3448 / 25.022727 | 168.42 | 337.24 |
| Parked, C2 disabled | 30.048 | 8.80% | 0 | 27.109 | 0 / 0 | 166.97 | 335.10 |
| Parked, C2 re-enabled | 30.048 | 9.23% | 0 | 1.964 | 3437 / 25.015727 | 167.96 | 338.02 |

SLIDLE occupies83.2% and83.3% of the enabled windows; disabling it shifts
residency to WFI and re-enabling restores real deeper residency. CPU utilization
is aggregated across the online cores, so the four-core and one-core percentages
are not an energy comparison. The raw OPP time-in-state deltas show the unchanged
schedutil policy, including short active high-frequency bursts. No new
cpuidle rejection appears. MONOTONIC/RAW drift is between-74211 and-124163ns.
CPU/PMIC temperatures are roughly39.9–45.1°C; conditions include external USB
power and radio state changes. No battery-life or electrical-power claim follows.

Receipt22 final status/health/dmesg confirms the original installed identity,
USB device role, schedutil598000–1300000kHz, C2 enabled, C3 disabled, same boot,
taint0 and all three mounted ext4 error counts0. Normal Wi-Fi is online; the
original screen is off and policy owns parking. Receipt23 stops only this pass's
verified temporary Dropbear listener; ordinary USB SSH remains available.

The exact physical hotplug power mapping in receipt11 is CPU1=0x800,
CPU2=0x400, CPU3=0x200 in both status copies. CPU3-off produces0x3d4e,
then CPU2-off0x394e, then CPU1-off0x314e; restoration reverses these values.
The kernel already used this descending MT6582 mapping. The new harness now
checks these exact operands and has a regression fixture for a mismatched
second status copy. An earlier unsealed package was rejected before handoff
while that harness correction was incorporated; no device flash occurred.

Receipt25 runs the final candidate harness against this still-installed baseline.
It rejects mismatched kernel, Linux, Reborn, rootfs, release and build identities
before any device mutation; only two read-only SSH operations occur. Receipt26
reconfirms same boot/taint0, C2 enabled, C3 disabled, normal owner policies and
mounted ext4 error counts0 at handoff.
