# Platform v1 physical master issues

Campaign started 2026-09-26. Evidence and target identity:
[bring-up report](PLATFORM-V1-PHYSICAL-BRINGUP.md). Confidence describes the
root cause, not the certainty of an observed symptom. Allowed confidence values:
CONFIRMED, STRONGLY_SUPPORTED, SUSPECTED, UNKNOWN. Pending rows are not passes.

## Hardware ceiling follow-up observations

Current private receipt prefix is
`out/platform-v1-hardware-ceiling/20260926T184237Z-physical01/`.
Owner confirms the SD128 ext4 card is a different known-good card; PHY-010's
original suspect FAT medium remains isolated. PHY-008 is not resolved by a
replacement card with a valid UUID. Historical evidence above remains retained.

| ID | Observation / confidence | Current action and acceptance boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHY-018 | Direct-fixture SBC is clean but control fails. Fixed Reborn playback is clean and owner confirms working play/pause; retained trace captures no incoming AVRCP command. Owner and trace evidence are distinct. | Direct fixture is not the registered product player; no current product control failure established. Fresh pair/reconnect/endurance/coexistence remain open. #31 |
| PHY-019 | ECM receive path repeatedly achieves ~40 Mb/s with 592–611 host sender retransmissions per measured run; transmit ~47 Mb/s with zero sender retransmissions. Symptom CONFIRMED; cause UNKNOWN. | Separate TCP/SFTP/crypto/storage; reconcile exact stock integrated DMA and retained PIO fallback. Host-listener timeout retained; device-listener direction succeeds. #27/#32 |
| PHY-020 | Reborn reports transient supplicant_unavailable/connection churn despite an associated working network, later Online. Root cause SUSPECTED control-command timeout. | Time control queries and inspect readiness transitions before changing timeouts or claiming radio disconnects. #31 |

Reborn sink repair (PHY-021, CONFIRMED): `rb_sink_open` omitted the returned
PCM device name, so the real player rejected its correctly opened sink contract.
ALSA null-PCM regression failed before the repair; seven audio tests and the
fixed ARM app pass. Receipt `29`: 182.955 s actual SBC, zero XRUN/recovery/decode/
playback errors; original app/session restored (`37`). Include in Hardware Batch
2; direct fixture success alone did not catch this product failure. #29/#31

Timer cause (PHY-003, CONFIRMED for the local-clockevent gap): exact stock starts
GPT6 as the CP15 physical counter; upstream GPT initialized only GPT1/2. Counter
was stopped on all cores. Bounded `34` test calibrates 12 samples near 13 MHz
and delivers 12 PPI29 one-shots, restores controls and unloads. Clean reboot
`39`–`41` returns taint 0. Integrated tickless/high-resolution/deeper idle still
unqualified; source/host-build work is grouped into Hardware Batch 2. #28/#34

Suspend follow-up (PHY-006, residual causes UNKNOWN): recovered receipt `49`
supersedes the incomplete SSH stream `43`. Freezer/devices/platform/processors
all return on boot `b3d92d70`, taint 0; CPU3/2/1 shut down and return. USB
terminates after devices with -EOVERFLOW (`IRQ=477827 events=05`), and WMT/radio
restart times out (-110) after processors. The old helper masks radio restore
failure, so rc=0 is not an acceptance result. Core and SPM entry have no receipt.
The owner-confirmed fresh Power Menu reboot recovers pinned SSH on `fffb5ac5`,
unchanged Physical 01, taint 0, pm_test none, all CPUs online, clean filesystem
counters and health OK. Hardware 02 adds USB overflow diagnostics and propagates
radio restore failures. Root causes and a successful complete resume remain
open; one detached, persistently logged stage plus host recovery verification
is required before advancing. #16/#28/#34

Core hotplug receipt `16` successfully steps 4→3→2→1→2→3→4 online cores,
with five-second idle and checked SHA-256 load windows at each count. CPU3/2/1
power-off and restart all succeed; final SPM broken=0, four cores online,
same boot, taint 0 and ext4 counters 0. This supersedes the old CPU3 mask
failure for manual hotplug only; it does not qualify full suspend, audio under
hotplug, automatic policy, power savings or endurance (PHY-003/PHY-006).

not assert an unmeasured causal explanation. More independent subsystem rows
will be added as the broad census exposes their actual state.
