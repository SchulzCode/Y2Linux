# CPU Final Fix 02 implementation and candidate receipt

Owner-authorized correction of the remaining real-device failures recorded by
the [Fix01 physical qualification](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX01-PHYSICAL-QUALIFICATION.md).
This pass changes software, produces **one** preserving candidate and does not
access or flash a Y2. It does not restart the CPU architecture: GPT6/GPT4/PPI29,
CNTFRQ, highres/NO_HZ, hotplug, 598/747.5/1040 MHz, schedutil, the eight
workload classes, interactive boost/expiry, thermal authority, WFI, bounded
playback and CONSYS isolated retry are unchanged and kept as regression
requirements. Software tests are not physical passes. Research provenance is in
the [Fix02 source ledger](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX02-SOURCES.md); the next run is
prepared in [Fix02 physical qualification](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX02-PHYSICAL-QUALIFICATION.md).

Starting Linux `0b8f810926c09510773eb76d1bf967a136b00f08`; starting Reborn
`6ddc553dd69a0158c9121df959ef135c50814a13`. Both trees were clean.

## 1. MSDC runtime clock ownership (SLIDLE blocker 0x3000)

**Root cause.** Patch `0009-y2-msdc-readonly.patch` returned early from
`msdc_runtime_suspend()`/`msdc_runtime_resume()` for every Y2 host under
`CONFIG_Y2_POWER`. The comment described s2idle retention, but these are the
ordinary runtime callbacks, so a host that runtime PM reported as `suspended`
never released `hclk`/`source_cg` (the same PERI MSDC0/MSDC1 CG, bits 12/13).
That is exactly the physically observed state: runtime suspended, enable count
2, blocker mask `0x3000` with radios off.

The bypass also hid a second problem: upstream `msdc_save_reg/restore_reg`
touch `PATCH_BIT2` (0xb8), `PAD_DS/CMD_TUNE` (0x188/0x18c), `EMMC50_CFG0/3` and
`SDC_FIFO_CFG`, none of which exist in the pinned MT6582 `mt_sd.h` register map.

**Correction.** Runtime PM and system sleep share one Y2 owner
(`y2_msdc_runtime_suspend/resume`). Suspend refuses (`-EBUSY`, runtime core
retries at the next autosuspend expiry) for a pending request, `DMA_CFG` busy,
`SDC_STS` SDC/CMD busy, FIFO RX/TX data, or an unserviced enabled interrupt.
When idle it saves the MT6582-defined image (CFG, IOCON, INTEN, SDC_CFG,
PATCH_BIT0/1, PAD_CTL0..2, PAD_TUNE, DAT_RDDLY0/1), selects `MSDC_CFG` MS mode
and releases the PERI CG, the exact stock `msdc_clksrc_onoff` order. Resume
ungates, waits 10 µs, verifies every retained register, restores and re-verifies
any lost one, rewrites SD/MMC mode with the saved divider (never replaying RST)
and waits for CKSTB. A failure leaves the clock enabled and reports; it never
re-gates a live host. No card command, reset, rail, pinctrl or re-initialization
is issued; `0029` still retains card power and addressing across system sleep
(no CMD5/poweroff notify/reinit). Since the host is almost always runtime-gated
when system sleep starts, "system sleep retention" is card and register-image
retention, not an ungated controller. Card detect on Y2 is `broken-cd` polling
with no internal CD register access, so no register is read while gated.

`y2_runtime_pm` exposes gated/suspends/resumes/retained/restored/last mismatch,
error and refusals by reason; it never touches a gated controller.

## 2. Automatic parking and SLIDLE reachability

**Root causes (source attribution of the recurring bursts).**

| Source | Class | Evidence / change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Readiness service started a full Python interpreter (`y2-platform media reconcile`) **every 3 s**, plus `space --cleanup` and `update health-ack` every 30 s | Avoidable periodic work | Start-up of CPython on a Cortex-A7 is exactly the quarter-second, ≤31 %, 1040-MHz (iowait/util) burst pattern. Reconcile is now started only when its own no-op condition is false (SD inventory changed or retry pending, checked in-process from sysfs). While dark the loop runs every 10 s (Reborn's `network.json` limit is 15 s) and maintenance every 300 s once update health is settled (30 s while pending, so the 180-s health deadline is unaffected). |
| Coordinator reset its window on any single 250-ms sample >10 % and on **every** cpufreq PRECHANGE >598 MHz | Wrong policy (harmless transients treated as demand) | Replaced by sustained measurement, below. |
| Coordinator's own 250-ms timer | Observer overhead | Now deferrable: an idle CPU is not woken to observe idleness. |
| Reborn main loop: 15-ms wake while the screen is off (~66/s) | Avoidable wake-ups | 50 ms while the screen is off; input still wakes promptly; audio/decode/control run on their own threads. |
| SD `broken-cd` polling (1 Hz CMD13), power daemon 1-Hz battery sample, Reborn 1-s playback lease renewal, 2-s supply read, Wi-Fi 3-s status, AVRCP 3-s refresh | Legitimate | Kept. Each is short; MSDC1 now re-gates 50 ms after each poll. |
| Test observer SSH/sampling | Observer overhead | The Fix02 harness is silent during its 240-s window and attributes CPU per process between two samples. |

**Coordinator.** `system-idle-policy.h` measures a time-weighted busy average
in milli-cores (τ 30 s, park only at ≤400 = 10 % of four cores) and the
time fraction above 598 MHz (≤25 %). Short bursts and single 1040-MHz raises
now only move the averages. One second of per-core saturation (≥85 %) is real
demand. Screen, workload lease, timer admission, disable and explicit
input/display/workload demand still reset immediately. Parking remains one CPU
per 5 s, CPU3→CPU2→CPU1, after the 60-s restore hold and a 30-s quiet window;
workload and display restores stay synchronous before acknowledgement; manual
offlines are never claimed. A pressure restore soon after parking doubles the
hold (60→960 s cap); ten stable parked minutes return it to 60 s, bounding
oscillation. Frequency raises are counted, not treated as demand. The `state`
parameter reports averages, quiet/longest window, hold and every reset by reason.

SLIDLE refusals are attributed separately (topology, lock, clock blocker, bus
state) with per-bit blocker counts and the last mask read with one CPU online,
so "mask 0 with four CPUs" can no longer be mistaken for idle clocks.

**C3.** Unchanged and still experimental/default off (`CPUIDLE_FLAG_OFF`).
`dormant_preflight` now evaluates, read-only and in entry order, the same
topology, frequency, timer, CIRQ, SPM domain and PERI/INFRA/bus clock
prerequisites and lists every unmet one.

## 3. High OPP / PWRAP readiness

**Actual register interpretation.** The Fix01 predicate required
`MUX_SEL(+0x00)=0`, `WRAP_EN(+0x04)=1` and `HIPRIO_ARB_EN(+0x50)=0x1ff`. The
retained Y2 preloader `pwrap_init` does write 0x1ff (Thumb `movw r1,#0x1ff;
str r1,[r5]` at file offset 0xc954, `r5` loaded from literal 0x1000d050). The
pinned MT6582 BSP defines only seven arbiter channels (MDINF bit0, WACS0..2
bits1..3, **DVFSINF bit4**, STAUPD bit5, GPSINF bit6); bits 7/8 are not
implemented and read back as zero. The M2-PWRAP-01 physical screen photographed
exactly `MUX:0 WRAP:1 WACS:1 INIT:1 ARB:0000007F` on this board. The predicate
therefore compared a readback with the written value and could never pass: it
was a wrong register interpretation, not a different initialization stage or
missing stock state (the stock kernel never writes HIPRIO_ARB_EN).

**Correction.** `pwrap-readiness-policy.h` requires wrapper mux, enabled
wrapper, no readback bits outside the implemented 7-bit field, DVFSINF and
WACS2 enabled, and the complete preloader field (0x7f); each refusal has a
name. It gates admission and is rechecked before every SPM voltage request
(a change after admission is `-EIO`/fault). `pwrap_readiness` exposes live and
last-admission MUX/WRAP/ARB, WACS2 enable/init/rdata and all eight DVFS slots,
read-only (no WACS2 FSM or PMIC access). Bin validation, active-bank detection,
NI feedback, voltage-before-frequency increases, frequency-before-voltage
decreases, settle/readback, rollback, 1040-MHz fallback and thermal authority
are unchanged. **High OPP support is software-ready**: on this board state the
existing automatic admission can now reach 1196 MHz @ 1.20 V and 1300 MHz @
1.25 V; physical voltage-changing DVFS remains NOT_TESTED until the next run.

## 4. Suspend diagnostics and recoverability

**Diagnostic failure root cause.** After the Fix01 staged request, both SRAM
slots were invalid (valid=0, sequence=0). That outcome is equally explained by a
journal that never wrote, by the owner's restart being a PMIC power cycle (which
cannot retain SRAM), or by loader overwrite; the durable file ended at the
coarse userspace `kernel_suspend`. Nothing had ever proven the SRAM path awake,
and recovery required the owner because a hang had no warm-reset path.

**SRAM journal design.** Unchanged slots A/B (0x0010dc00/0x0010dc80, magic
written last, checksum, wrapping sequence) and Boot-ROM stamp (0x0010dd00).
The claimed window grows to 0x0010dc00..0x0010e0ff, inside the stock
RAM-console allocation (proven by `mt_map_io`/`ram_console_early_init`). A scan
of the retained FM preloader and LK finds references only to 0x0010f000.. and
the preloader's RAM-console guard (which mutates only on magic 0x43474244);
0x0010dc00..0x0010e0ff is referenced by neither. New content: a self-test
scratch area and a 24-entry device-callback ring (sequence written last).

**Awake validation** (`/sys/firmware/y2_pm/selftest`, write `run`): serialized
with system sleep; marks SELFTEST_A and SELFTEST_B and reads every word back
through a second, independent `ioremap` of the same physical SRAM; checks
checksum, sequence +1, slot alternation and that the previous record survives;
writes and restores the reset stamp; verifies the ring; writes a
sequence-derived scratch pattern; refuses a RAM-console magic in slot 0. The
next boot reports (`retention`) whether SELFTEST_B and the scratch pattern
survived: one ordinary warm reboot proves electrical retention without
entering suspend. The harness only reboots with `--allow-warm-reboot`.

**Earlier breadcrumbs.** HELPER_REQUEST (helper, before radio quiesce),
SUSPEND_REQUEST, FILESYSTEM_SYNCED, TASKS_FROZEN, PLATFORM_BEGIN,
DPM_PREPARE_BEGIN, DPM_PREPARED, DEVICES_SUSPENDED, LATE_SUSPENDED,
NOIRQ_SUSPENDED, SECONDARIES_DISABLING/OFF, SYSCORE_SUSPENDED, PLATFORM_ENTER,
then the existing CIRQ/PCM/context/SPM entry/return/restore marks, TEST_RETURN
and EXIT. The first failing stage and error are kept.

**Device-callback trace.** `dpm_run_callback`, prepare and complete record
enter/leave, phase and result with the device name (tail-preserving, 20 bytes)
in the ring for every device (charger, MUSB, MMC, CONSYS, BT, DRM, GPU, AFE/
CS43131, RTC, input included). Raw MMIO word stores only; no logging in noirq.
`devices` and `devices_previous` show this and the previous boot's trail.

**Recoverable staged tests.** An owner-armed one-shot backstop
(`backstop_s`, 10..30 s) starts the RGU watchdog at `pm_suspend` entry, is
pinged on stage progress and stopped at exit. Staged pm_test runs are covered
through every phase; a full sleep pauses it only around SPM entry and restarts
it after return. Expiry uses the same RGU reset path as Linux `reboot`, so a
stall becomes a warm reset that keeps the journal instead of a hang needing an
owner power cycle. It is refused while userspace owns `/dev/watchdog` and is
invisible to the watchdog core (upstream suspend/resume never touch it).

**Charger.** The kernel already refuses only while the charger engine is
active (or failed to stop); USB-online HOLD/"Not charging" legitimately
proceeds. `charger_state.classify` separates USB present, charging active,
charger hold and not charging; refusal is expected (and verified from the
retained prepare result `-16` on the charger device) only when active.

**SPM/wake.** RTC, Power key/PMIC EINT25, CIRQ, wake mask, CPU0 vector and
context restoration were re-reviewed and are unchanged: no new evidence shows a
defect, and the failed staged request never reached SPM. The next failure will
now name the first boundary.

## 5. USB loaded-transfer failure

**Findings.** Every `y2_usb_fail()` was terminal until reboot and none recorded
which of nine sites fired. Two are not transport faults: a single failed
PMIC/PWRAP sample in the 250-ms supply monitor, and any write-free reconnect
preflight refusal right after a VBUS/CHRDET dip (plausible with charging plus
1040-MHz load) tore USB down permanently while the UI stayed usable — matching
the Fix01 observation. A DMA bus error or IRQ storm is also terminal by design.
Because the observer died with USB, the actual site is not established.

**Correction.** The monitor needs one second of consecutive failed samples; a
write-free reconnect refusal is retried for ten seconds while the cable is
present. Refusals after a session write, DMA bus errors and IRQ storms remain
terminal (no stale interrupt loop). The first terminal fault freezes its reason
and a read-only snapshot (L1/USB/TX/RX status+masks, POWER, DEVCTL, FADDR,
per-endpoint CSR/RXCOUNT with INDEX restored, DMA INTR and all eight channel
control/address/count) for the independent Wi-Fi observer, and notes the
reason in the retained ring. Counters add peak per-jiffy IRQ burst,
unexplained IRQs, per-channel bus errors, tolerance retries and runtime-PM
state. Inventra DMA (not disabled), `y2.usb_dma=off`/allocation PIO fallback
and the USB SSH recovery architecture are unchanged. If a DMA bus error is
captured next run, its snapshot identifies channel, endpoint and address for a
targeted fix; the stock MT6582 DMA IRQ path matches upstream's spurious-IRQ
recovery, so no divergence was imported blindly.

## Tests added

`tests/test_cpu_fix02.py` executes the real driver functions on host models:
MSDC busy reasons/gate/retain/restore/failure unwind and root/SD safety
invariants; PWRAP operands, admission, feedback mismatch, failed SPM request,
fault latch, wrapper change after admission, slot tampering and transition
ordering/rollback/thermal cap; coordinator parking order under the measured
background, lease/display/demand restore, hysteresis, pressure escalation
bound and sustained-load refusal; screen-off background gating; journal
self-test success and injected failures, stage progression, torn ring entries,
backstop lifecycle; USB tolerance and attribution; charger classification;
harness evaluation helpers and plan safety. Existing Fix01, slow-idle,
USB-failure and USB-reconnect fixtures were updated to the new contracts.
