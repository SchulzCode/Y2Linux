# Platform v1 physical qualification

## Owner-connected Wi-Fi check — 2026-09-25

**PARTIAL: Wi-Fi association, DHCP, default route, router and Internet-IP
reachability PASS; DNS FAIL.** The owner connected to their router and explicitly
requested this narrow check. It does not waive the retained Session A warning
gate or complete Session C. Current coverage is A FAIL, B NOT_TESTED, C PARTIAL
with the DNS failure below, D NOT_TESTED. No configuration, credentials, service,
firmware or hardware policy was changed, and no throughput/reconnect test ran.

Installed identity is unchanged: Linux
`814c2f3470566021c1a9c43037fd868de8b2df9c`, Reborn
`155608393f6acfc6657f2f2e23cd07d0533479c6`, build
`Y2LINUX-PLATFORM-V1-TELEMETRY-01`, rootfs `2025.02.18-platform-v1.2`, retained
kernel `6.18.0-y2linux-platform-v1-candidate-01`. Boot ID remains
`3194fa9d-2dee-4105-86f0-4021580bf8d0`. Full versions match before and after.
Expected image hashes are the Telemetry 01 hashes below; no whole-image readback
is claimed. Host timestamps, complete commands and raw results are private in
`evidence-private/platform-v1-physical-qualification/20260925T154016Z-owner-wifi-check/`.
The owner reports connecting to the router; no other manual observation was
requested. The automatic checks below have no separate manual observation.

| Test / command | Measured result | Status | Evidence basename |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `y2-status system --json`; capabilities; full health; `dmesg -r` before/after | Exact same candidate/boot; complete mandatory captures; remaining readiness/warning limits retained | PARTIAL | `01`–`04`, `13`–`16`, `20`–`23` receipts |
| `wpa_cli -i wlan0 status` | COMPLETED, WPA2-PSK/CCMP, 2422 MHz, 20 MHz channel | PASS (association only) | `06-wpa-status` |
| `ip -j -4 addr show dev wlan0`; DHCP record | Address `192.168.123.136`; matching lease, no DHCP error, 86400-second lease | PASS | `07-address`, `09-dhcp-dns` |
| `ip -j -4 route show` | Default via `192.168.123.1` on wlan0, metric 100 | PASS | `08-route` |
| `y2-platform network-check --peer 192.168.123.1 --seconds 5` | Refused with wifi_not_online; no throughput requested | FAIL (platform admission) | `10-platform-network-check` |
| `ping -I wlan0 -c 5 -W 2 192.168.123.1` | 5/5 replies, sample loss 0%; RTT min/avg/max 1.332/1.532/1.776 ms | PASS (bounded router reachability) | `11-router-ping` |
| Isolated Python `socket.getaddrinfo("pool.ntp.org", None, AF_INET)` using configured resolver | EAI_AGAIN / temporary name-resolution failure after 2.026 s | FAIL | `12-dns-query` |
| Same resolver query for `example.com` | EAI_AGAIN after 2.028 s | FAIL | `18-dns-second-host` |
| `ping -I wlan0 -c 3 -W 2 1.1.1.1` | 3/3 replies, sample loss 0%; RTT min/avg/max 11.528/11.846/12.275 ms | PASS (bounded Internet-IP reachability) | `19-internet-ip-ping` |

DHCP supplied DNS server `192.168.123.1`; resolv.conf names that server. The
platform's DNS probe also reports failure. These checks demonstrate working
Wi-Fi/IP routing and a resolver-path failure; they do not isolate whether the
cause is the router DNS service, DNS packet handling or resolver behavior on Y2.
No alternate DNS server was configured. Native supplicant status succeeds while
the platform observer still reports Starting/supplicant_unavailable, retaining
the separate intermittent query/readiness problem. Online is **not** accepted
without DNS. No speed, sustained loss, reconnect, TLS or endurance claim follows
from these eight ping replies. The next focused diagnosis is the DNS path and
readiness reporting; no new image has yet been shown necessary by this check.

Before/after kernel buffers each contain 67 priority 0–4 entries: the previous
14 plus 53 display log rate-limit notices accumulated before this connection
check. No new critical Oops/panic/WARN-stack/ext4-I/O signature was found during
the check. Existing warning and broader physical-acceptance gates remain open.

## Latest attempt: installed Telemetry 01 — 2026-09-25

Read-only follow-up on the same boot: `wpa_cli ping` returns PONG, status returns
DISCONNECTED, and list_networks has **zero network rows**. No connection has been
configured, so not_authenticated alone is not a demonstrated Wi-Fi defect.
The three direct SSH queries took 2.08–2.12 s, while a subsequent on-device
comparison using the installed command runner returned successfully in 0.118 s
at a 1-second deadline and 0.012 s at 4 seconds. The observer's 1-second query
deadline can miss slower responses, but this comparison did not reproduce a
timeout or establish its cause. Closing health remains DEGRADED with
supplicant_unavailable. No credentials, network selection or restart occurred.

Timer inspection shows four dummy per-CPU clockevents backed by the real
`mtk-clkevt` periodic broadcast timer, broadcast mask `f`, 10,000,000 ns timer
resolution, highres=0 and nohz=0. The retained candidate configuration has
CONFIG_HZ=100 and CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS unset. This narrows the warning to the
current periodic-timer limitation; it does not mean the Y2 has no working timer.
Enabling high-resolution/tickless behavior or strict kernel RWX is a separate
kernel validation scope. The original warning stop rule remains unchanged;
continuing with named limitations requires explicit owner disposition, and
software changes require a separately authorized repair pass.

Follow-up evidence:
`evidence-private/platform-v1-physical-qualification/20260925T152936Z-readonly-triage/`.
Before/after status/capabilities/health/dmesg and per-command receipts are retained.
The `/proc/488/stack` read was unavailable; the later wchan was do_select. A
single earlier D-state process snapshot does not establish a persistent hang.
No new Session A workload or Session C test was activated by this diagnosis.

**Telemetry repairs PASS in this observed scope. Session A FAIL at the retained
kernel-warning gate; B/C/D NOT_TESTED. No physical or endurance promotion.**
The owner installed the corrective image, then authorized continuation of the
original qualification. No source, firmware, service, radio or hardware-policy
change was made by this retest. No reboot, rescue transition or workload started.

The exact installed metadata and nine file hashes match
`out/y2linux-platform-v1-telemetry-01-candidate/`. New boot ID:
`3194fa9d-2dee-4105-86f0-4021580bf8d0`. Identity:

Hash comparison covers the five replacement files and four Reborn ELFs; it is
not whole installed-image readback. `uname -a` is the exact same kernel string
recorded in the earlier attempt below. The saved owner-authorized host pin and
existing login key still work; the prior independent-console-verification
limitation remains. Host UTC below is authoritative: device wall time is still
anchored to the September 23 build floor, NTP is not established and TLS readiness
is false. RTC reads August 2022; no retention claim is made.

Private evidence (mode 0700, Git ignored):
`evidence-private/platform-v1-physical-qualification/20260925T151959Z-telemetry01/`.
Every command has UTC/arguments/exit/duration/raw-output receipts. The test
register supplies full source/image identity, boot ID, observation, status and
limits for every attempted test and remaining gate. The original run's sealed
evidence is preserved separately. All rows below use the identity/boot above.

| Host UTC | Command / observation | Measured result | Status | Evidence basename |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15:20:36 | `y2-status system --json` | Valid exact-identity JSON; exit 0; 2.692 s including SSH | PASS | `01-system` |
| 15:20:38 | `y2-platform capabilities` | Exit 0; 0.755 s; declarations captured | PASS (query) | `02-capabilities` |
| 15:20:39 | `y2-health --full --json` | Valid JSON; 3.525 s; exit 1, FAILED for Wi-Fi `not_authenticated`; no exception | FAIL (readiness), PASS (dispatch repair) | `03-health-full` |
| 15:20:43 | `uname -a`, boot ID, versions, build ID and os-release reads | Full metadata matches candidate; new boot ID | PASS | `04-uname` through `07-release` |
| 15:20:43 | `dmesg -r` | 14 kernel facility priority 0–4 entries; stop rule applies | FAIL (warning gate) | `08-dmesg` |
| Owner reply on this boot | Look at screen and assess warmth; no control action | “Main menu visible; normal warmth” | PARTIAL | `owner-observations.json` |
| 15:22:27 | `y2-platform collect --seconds 1 --interval 1 --warmup 0 --reborn --pss --workload session-a-stop-baseline` | One passive sample; actual collector duration 2.852 s, SSH total 3.687 s; values below | PARTIAL | `09-stop-collection` |
| 15:22:31 | `sha256sum` of five replacement files and four Reborn ELFs | All nine match; 4.595 s | PASS | `10-installed-hashes`, `installed-hash-comparison.json` |
| 15:22:35 | `y2-status system --json` | Valid same-boot JSON; exit 0; 3.550 s | PASS | `11-post-system` |
| 15:22:39 | `y2-platform capabilities` | Exit 0; 0.763 s | PASS (query) | `12-post-capabilities` |
| 15:22:39 | `y2-health --full --json` | Valid JSON; exit 0; 3.576 s; DEGRADED, Wi-Fi `supplicant_unavailable` | PARTIAL | `13-post-health-full` |
| 15:22:43 | `dmesg -r` | Same 14 kernel entries; no new warning class | FAIL (warning gate) | `14-post-dmesg`, `kernel-review.json` |
| 15:22:43 | Boot/uptime/taint/normal_boot, Reborn proc identity, process/wakeup-source table, ext4 counters | Same boot, taint 0, normal_boot 1, both ext4 error counters 0; no leftover status/wakeup reader | PASS (narrow context) | `15-final-context` |

The wakeup counter correctly reports **null / `command_timeout`** while BAT0
reports Charging and the charger wakeup source is active. The final process
table contains no lingering counter reader or `pm_get_wakeup_count` wait. This
proves the repaired observation path on this boot, not long-run collection.
Health now reports actual readiness, including failures, instead of crashing.
The Wi-Fi reason changes from `not_authenticated` to `supplicant_unavailable`;
no service restart, password entry, AP test or radio action was performed. Its
cause and end-to-end connectivity remain unqualified.

Both root and data are Ready, separate read-write ext4 mounts with the expected
UUIDs and `11230000.mmc` controller. On this boot they enumerate as
`/dev/mmcblk0p5` and `/dev/mmcblk0p7`; names changed with enumeration, controller
and UUID identity did not. Boot fsck reports both clean. An SD device enumerates
but `/media/sd` is unavailable; no mount/removal/benchmark was attempted.

Normal-boot markers show switch_root 9.740 s, first frame 62.785 s, and
application_ready 70.058 s. Reborn PID 363, start ticks 2824 and `/usr/bin/reborn`
match the first-frame record. Previous boot `083d4abb-a447-4ac6-a063-e8898c150bca`
is recorded as orderly shutdown_complete, with previous-log tail metadata
retained; this is not one of the three requested controlled reboot trials.
Library readiness, rescue entry/return and all input/playback checks remain open.

Snapshot: CPU 48.800°C, PMIC 45.713°C; battery 4,024,072 µV. MemTotal 952,304 KiB,
MemAvailable 865,868, LOWMEM 723,952, HIGHMEM 228,352, cache 56,684, slab 11,004.
Reborn RSS 23,532 KiB, 16 threads; requested PSS remains **null**, not zero.
Frequency time-in-state counters are 20,643 / 164 / 7,214 USER_HZ ticks at
598 / 747.5 / 1040 MHz. Per-core WFI cumulative time is approximately
249.569 / 249.092 / 256.292 / 250.001 seconds. These are mixed-boot counters,
not idle/playback/scan workload utilization, power savings or endurance results.
No governor/OPP/voltage change occurred. ALSA hw_params is `closed`; no sound
or XRUN-under-playback result is inferred.

The 14 kernel entries repeat the previously reviewed timer/cache, LED-node,
hardening, stock p8 clipping, regulator get_mode, Bluetooth feature quirk,
Wi-Fi logging and rate-limit classes. Another 31 warning-priority lines have
non-kernel facility (for example raw PRI 12) and are counted separately. No new
Oops/panic/WARN-stack/ext4/I/O signature was found; taint remains zero. None of
these observations waives the owner's kernel-warning stop rule. See the
[source-backed warning review](PLATFORM-V1-TELEMETRY-01.md#warning-review).

## Earlier attempt: original UI candidate

2026-09-25 UTC. Owner-supervised qualification of the already-installed
`out/y2linux-reborn-ui-v1-candidate/`, clarified by the owner after the initial
identity check found a different Reborn from the original plain Platform v1
package. The [owner test plan](PLATFORM-V1-OWNER-QUALIFICATION.md) and explicit
no-flash/no-build/no-production-change limits remain authoritative.

**Session A: FAIL; stopped at baseline. Sessions B/C/D: NOT_TESTED.** Identity
metadata and installed application hashes match the owner-clarified package.
Two mandatory telemetry commands fail, and kernel warning/error-priority
messages trigger the owner's Session A stop rule. No physical or endurance
acceptance is declared. Sessions E/F/G and unattended long runs remain unstarted
and separately gated. Recommended next step: corrective software work and
warning review, then repeat Session A under the resulting exact identity.

Subsequent owner-authorized [telemetry repair](PLATFORM-V1-TELEMETRY-01.md) is
complete at host/ARM/image scope. Its new candidate has not been installed.
This physical record describes the original image and remains unchanged in
result; software checks do not supersede its failures or missing physical tests.

## Identity

Authenticated identity read: 2026-09-25 14:23:49 UTC. Boot ID:
`083d4abb-a447-4ac6-a063-e8898c150bca`.

| Field | Observed |
| --- | --- |

| UI review metadata | `4fe236feaa986dccd014758a860554d18b94fbab` |

All installed versions JSON fields equal the clarified package metadata.
The original target expected Reborn `6c8aa128550ec80addd08ef3145e9d5a846ddf2e`
/ `0.1.0`; qualification stopped at that mismatch until the owner supplied the
actual package path. Metadata matching is not installed-image readback.

Local integrity: plain Platform v1 package 1,112/1,112 checksums; clarified UI
candidate 133/133. UI root SHA-256:
`edcecfaae26b8102c071000b5d2e9e5f84626ad08e3ff5818b050174f301a044`.
Required Platform v1 BOOTIMG SHA-256:
`f7b4a950a0504a411ad72db0aac9398f04dc1ccabd6a6a0a3a7fdab198ca2622`.
These are expected local image hashes, not measured whole installed images.
All four installed application ELF SHA-256 values match this UI candidate's
manifest: `reborn`, `rebornctl`, `reborn-bench`, and `libreborn_media.so`.
Installed platform `cli.py` and `observe.py` hashes also match the inspected
local source; no runtime replacement was made.

## Evidence and preliminary results

Private directory (Git ignored, mode 0700):

```text
evidence-private/platform-v1-physical-qualification/20260925T141911Z-owner/
```

Per-command receipts retain host UTC, exact command/SSH arguments, exit status,
elapsed time, stdout/stderr and limitations. `test-register.json` records each
attempted or unexecuted test, exact source/image context, boot ID or its limits,
timestamp, command, result, manual observation, status and evidence path.
`test-register-original-preflight.json` preserves the original-target preflight.
`SHA256SUMS` covers the final private evidence bundle.

The owner reports **“i just see the main menu normal warm”**. This confirms a
visible main menu and subjective normal warmth only. No buttons, playback,
screen cycling or cable action were requested. The annotation time is retained
in `owner-observations.json`; an exact physical observation time was not supplied.

The initial failed SSH command obtained no boot ID. Later diagnostics are
bracketed by the same authenticated boot ID through 14:36:05 UTC; the stalled
status PID was identified in that boot. Device wall time was not verified and
is not substituted for host UTC. No private-key contents, passwords, bond
secrets, NVRAM or calibration were inspected or exported.

| Host UTC | Command / action | Measurement | Status | Evidence basename |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 14:19:11 | `y2-status system --json` through pinned SSH | SSH exit 255: stale host key; no command output | FAIL | `01-system` |
| 14:21:30 | Host USB sysfs and `ip route get 10.42.0.1` | ACM/ECM same USB parent, direct `10.42.0.2` route; reported USB speed 480 Mbit/s, not measured throughput | PARTIAL | `host-usb-topology.json` |
| 14:22:30 | Owner-authorized host-key update | Only Y2 host entry replaced, original retained; existing login key and strict checking preserved | PASS | `host-trust-update.json` |
| 14:22:30–14:23:20 | `y2-status system --json` | 50.050 s timeout; no stdout/stderr; host wrapper code 124 | FAIL | `11-system` |
| 14:23:49 | `uname -a; cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id; cat /etc/y2linux/versions.json; cat /etc/y2linux/build-id; cat /etc/os-release` | Exit 0, 0.209 s; identity above; authenticated USB shell works | PASS | `18-ssh-identity-diagnostic` |
| After owner clarification | Compare observed versions to UI candidate metadata | All fields equal; original mismatch retained | PASS | `target-clarification.json` |

The new host pin was accepted on explicit owner instruction with direct USB
topology evidence; it was not independently read from a device console.
Authenticated SSH alone does not prove password rejection, USB-only binding,
Wi-Fi exclusion or SFTP readiness. The status timeout and health exception are
diagnosed below; no silent software fix or service restart has been performed.

## Session A evidence and failures

All rows below use the exact UI candidate identity and boot ID above. The
private receipt named in each row contains the complete command, timestamps,
exit status and unabridged output. Manual observation is absent except for the
display/warmth row. PASS applies only to the stated narrow observation.

| 14:32:48–49 | Boot-stage, application-ready and boot-history JSON reads | Timings below; first-frame record carries current boot ID and Reborn PID/start ticks; prior UI boot marked orderly | PARTIAL | `26-boot-readiness` |
| 14:32:49 | Mountinfo, controller sysfs, `blkid -p`, geometry, ext4 counters, `df -k` | Expected controller/UUIDs/geometry, separate read-write mounts; both error counters 0 | PASS (identity/current mounts) | `27-storage-identity` |
| 14:32:49 | Thermal/power/radio sysfs, ALSA hw_params, meminfo | CPU 48.500°C; PMIC 46.298°C; memory snapshot below; PCM closed | PARTIAL | `28-safety-readings` |
| 14:32:49–54 | Installed ELF `sha256sum`; `timeout -s TERM -k 2 5 y2-audio-contract` | Four matching ELF hashes; query exit 0, no PCM started; constraints below | PASS (hashes/query only) | `29-installed-elfs` |
| Owner observation during this boot | Look at screen and assess case warmth without operating controls | Main menu visible; normally warm | PARTIAL (display/heat only) | `owner-observations.json` |
| 14:34:44 | Exact-identity cleanup of the orphaned diagnostic PID | SIGTERM only to PID 1945 after boot/start-ticks/cmdline/executable checks | PASS (collection cleanup) | `30-collector-cleanup` |
| 14:34:44–49 | `timeout -s TERM -k 2 5 y2-status system --json` | No output; SSH invocation returns 255 after 5.217 s; subsequent independent SSH works | FAIL | `31-post-system` |
| 14:36:03–04 | `y2-platform capabilities` | Exit 0; after-session capability capture | PASS | `32-post-capabilities` |
| 14:36:04–05 | `y2-health --full --json` | Same exception, exit 1, 0.767 s | FAIL | `33-post-health` |
| 14:36:05 | `dmesg -r` | 200,810 bytes; same 28 kernel priority 0–4 entries | FAIL (warning gate) | `34-post-dmesg`, `kernel-review.json` |
| 14:36:05 | Boot ID, taint, uptime, process list and ext4 error counters | Same boot, taint 0, both error counters 0, no lingering status queries; SSH available | PASS (final context) | `35-post-context` |

The required before/after baseline commands were attempted and preserved, but
the baseline is **incomplete** because system status and health produced no
valid JSON. Direct diagnostic reads are supplemental evidence, not replacements
that make the failed public commands pass. Combined shell commands retain errors
even when the last command exits 0: `/proc/1945/stack` was unavailable, and the
queried `/run/y2/services.json` and `/data/reborn/logs/supervisor-last.json` did not
exist. Those absent queried paths alone do not prove a failed production service.

### Confirmed telemetry defects

1. **Health CLI dispatch fails.** In
   [cli.py](../../tools/platform/y2_platform/cli.py), the `network-check` branch
   imports a local `check` inside `main()`. That shadows the module-level health
   function throughout `main()`. The health branch calls this unassigned local
   at line 197, producing the captured `UnboundLocalError`. Owning subsystem:
   platform CLI dispatch. This is independent of physical sensor health.
2. **Status observation can block indefinitely.**
   [observe.py](../../tools/platform/y2_platform/observe.py) reads
   `/sys/power/wakeup_count` synchronously in `cpu()`. The actual process was
   sleeping in `pm_get_wakeup_count` with that FD open. Kernel `wakeup_count_show`
   calls `pm_get_wakeup_count(..., true)`, which waits for active wakeup events
   to finish. The charger wakeup source was active. Owning subsystem: platform
   observation/bounding; this is not evidence that charger wake policy should
   be changed. Snapshot/collection paths sharing `cpu()` require review before
   dependable baseline or endurance collection. The original host timeout left
   its remote read process alive; that exact diagnostic process was cleaned up.

No production file, charger policy, wakeup source, service or kernel parameter
was changed to bypass either defect. No software fix was implemented.

### Kernel findings and stop rule

The retained before/after buffers each contain **28 priority 0–4 kernel log
entries**, including repeated rate-limiting notices. These are not 28 independent
crashes. There are no retained `WARNING:` stack reports, Oops, kernel panic,
`EXT4-fs error` or `I/O error` matches; taint remains 0. Severity-coded warnings
still trigger the owner's stop condition. Relevant messages include:

| Kernel message | Likely owning area / limitation |
| --- | --- |
| `dummy_timer is not functional.` (four entries) | Timer/clockevent configuration; boot-time warning, not a measured reset |
| `cacheinfo: Unable to detect cache hierarchy for CPU 0` | CPU/cache description |
| `mt6323-led: Failed to locate of_node [id: -1]` | PMIC LED driver/device-tree lookup |
| `Kernel memory protection not selected by kernel config.` | Kernel configuration/hardening |
| `mmcblk1: p8 size 4291225599 extends beyond EOD, truncated` | Retained stock partition-layout clipping; not an observed ext4 corruption; no table change attempted |
| `regulator VCAMA doesn't support get_mode`; same for `VRTC` | Regulator capability/query handling |
| `Bluetooth: hci0: broken local ext features page 2` | Bluetooth controller/feature compatibility; pairing/audio remain untested |
| MSDC/OVL/printk callbacks or lines suppressed | Diagnostic rate limiting; limits completeness of some log streams |
| `<wifi> send Wi-Fi Start command` at warning priority | Driver severity convention; not independently a failed association |

An early informational `Temperature check failed (-61)` precedes later readable
CPU/PMIC temperatures; retain it without treating current thermometry as absent.
Early ext4 orphan cleanup is followed by both filesystems reporting clean and
zero current error counters. It is not counted as a new filesystem error.
Charger log samples carry `fault=0x0`; this does not qualify charging. Radio
snapshot reports `error=0 transport_errors=0 recoveries=0`; no packet-loss
percentage or connection success is inferred.

No owner reboots, rescue transition, input cycle, playback, benchmark or radio
test followed the warning review. Session A is incomplete and failed; no
more-invasive session was started. No historical warning is silently waived.

### Narrow positive observations

Boot stages on the observed boot: initramfs 0.62 s; storage discovery 0.91 s;
preflight 7.54 s; fsck 9.12–9.28 s; root/data mounted 9.65 s; switch_root 9.73 s;
platform start 23.498 s; services-started marker 48.485 s; first-frame readiness
record **57.785 s**; application-ready stage **64.718 s**. These are recorded
monotonic boot times, not a new cold-boot timing experiment. Actual library-ready
timing and full service health remain unverified. Historical orderly-shutdown
records do not count as the requested three reboot tests.

Internal eMMC is on `11230000.mmc`, exposing 15,203,328 sectors. Y2ROOT is
`/dev/mmcblk1p5`, UUID `79324c69-6e75-4801-8000-000000000101`, start 166,912,
length 1,679,360 sectors. Y2DATA is `/dev/mmcblk1p7`, UUID
`79324c69-6e75-4801-8000-000000000102`, start 2,104,320, length 1,638,400 sectors.
Both are separate ext4 read-write mounts; `/data` also has `nosuid,nodev`.
Boot fsck reports both clean; both current `errors_count` values are 0 before
and after collection. Available space: root 360,592 KiB, data 730,824 KiB.
This does not measure write durability, throughput or recovery under faults.

Instantaneous memory snapshot, KiB: MemTotal 952,304; MemAvailable 866,608;
LowTotal 723,952; HighTotal 228,352; Cached 53,356; Slab 11,308. Reborn RSS/PSS,
memory growth, workload CPU and frequency/WFI residency were not collected.
CPU 48.500°C and PMIC 46.298°C are die-sensor snapshots, not pack temperature
or a thermal-load qualification. Battery telemetry was 3,893,994 µV; configured
current is not measured battery current or energy.

`y2-audio-contract` accepts S16 stereo 44.1-kHz constraints. It also reports
direct 48-kHz constraints; the product-enabled profile remains **S16 stereo
44.1 kHz only**. S24/S32 and 88.2/96-kHz constraints are rejected. The command
reports `pcm_started:false`; captured hw_params says `closed`. No playback,
unsupported mode or listening test occurred.

| 30 | Remaining physical gates | Three reboots and rescue, service/library readiness, full input/display cycles, audible wired audio, USB/SFTP confinement, all B–D and endurance; E/F/G retain their separate gates |
| 31 | Acceptable as Platform v1 Core? | **Not yet:** mandatory baseline tools fail, warning stop rule triggered, and required sessions remain incomplete |
| 32 | Recommended next test/work | Corrective software work and explicit warning review, then repeat Session A with exact resulting versions; endurance, power, OTA and Reborn acceptance are not the next boundary |

Unexecuted checks have no command execution timestamp, measurement or manual
observation. The private register enumerates these as NOT_TESTED, including all
input/audio actions, all three reboots and rescue, storage/SD lifecycle, SQLite
sizes, workload resource comparisons, Wi-Fi state/failure/reconnect/throughput
cases and Bluetooth/SBC/AVRCP/coexistence cases. No short observation is used to
infer endurance or electrical durability.

## Longer collections prepared, not started

Seven `ui-plan-*.json` records were generated locally using:

```sh
python3 tools/platform/qualify.py capture --profile wired-8h \
  --versions out/y2linux-reborn-ui-v1-candidate/metadata/versions.json
```

Profiles: wired 8h; Bluetooth 8h; Wi-Fi + playback; Wi-Fi + Bluetooth;
scan + playback; SD cycles; USB cycles. All report `network_contacted:false`.
No `--run` was used. The original plain-candidate `plan-*.json` files remain
historical and must not be used for this differing source pair.

Execution requires corrected/verified telemetry, relevant short sessions passed,
an exact versions file for the actual resulting installed pair, explicit owner
approval for duration/workload, a fresh private output directory, the existing
owner private-key path and the verified/current host pin. The collector does not
start a workload or operate hardware. Approval for an eight-hour run has not
been requested because these prerequisites have not passed.

Wired requires observed S16 stereo 44.1-kHz media at an owner-selected safe
volume. Bluetooth requires a known paired/trusted peer, actual negotiated SBC
PCM and listening confirmation. Wi-Fi combinations require a controlled AP and
throughput peer plus proven address/route/DNS. Scan requires a declared dataset
and playback workload. SD/USB cycles require scheduled manual observations;
request each removal/reinsert explicitly and use disposable media for surprise
removal. Record media hashes, workload, observations, collection overhead,
counter changes and gaps. Preserve the same stop conditions.

Only documentation and private host evidence were written in this repository.
The host's Y2 public host-key pin was updated on owner instruction. On-device
cleanup only terminated the exact query started by this qualification attempt;
production code, services, hardware policy and protected data were not changed.
The final process snapshot confirms no leftover status query. No build, flash,
production test suite, reboot or long workload was run. Validation is limited
to evidence consistency/hashes, local links and `git diff --check`.
