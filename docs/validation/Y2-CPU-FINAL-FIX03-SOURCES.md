Fix03 uses no new ROM, recovery or calibration input. The BSP files fetched
for this batch are kept private in `out/cpu-final-fix03/source/`, with a SHA256
`manifest.json`, and go into the candidate's source collection. The
[Fix02 ledger](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX02-SOURCES.md) still covers MSDC, PWRAP, MUSB
DMA and the RAM-console map.

| Reference | Narrow use |

| [BQ/Ubuntu krillin 874057f3](https://github.com/ubports/kernel_krillin/tree/874057f3c28735d606385361fb9a4cd4545ceba6/mediatek) `platform/mt6582/kernel/core/mt_dcm.c` and `include/mach/mt_dcm.h` | `DCM_CFG` is `INFRA_BASE + 0x0004` (TOPCKGEN+4, "AXI bus dcm"). `DCM_ENABLE_DCM_CFG` is undefined, so DCM init never writes it ("default value are all 0, use default value"). `bus_dcm_enable` writes `1 << 7 \| 0xF` (0x8f) and `bus_dcm_disable` clears only bit 7, so the stock steady state is 0x00, then 0x0f after the first idle |
| same, `core/mt_idle.c` | `slidle_before_wfi`/`after_wfi` and `spm_dpidle_before_wfi`/`after_wfi` call `bus_dcm_enable`/`disable` without checking the inherited value; the stock slidle PERI mask is `0x00f00800` |
| same, `core/include/mach/mt_wdt.h`, `drivers/wdt/mtk_wdt.c` | `MTK_WDT_STATUS` is `+0x0c`, with bits HWWDT `0x80000000`, SWWDT `0x40000000`, IRQWDT `0x20000000`, DEBUGWDT `0x00080000`, SPMWDT `0x0001`. The stock driver only reads it (`wdt_dump_reg`, FIQ copy into `NONRST_REG`) |
| same, `core/mt_spm_sleep.c` | Reference for the SPM sleep/resume sequence around UART and wake. Fix03 changes nothing there |
| `.../usb20/musb_gadget.c` and `musbhsdma.c` (Fix02 ledger) | Stock RX keeps a packet pending without a request (`rx_pending`). The DMA IRQ handler is the same W1C/spurious-recovery path as upstream. A mode-0 RX packet costs one endpoint and one DMA interrupt |
| [Linux 6.18](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/?h=v6.18) locked local source | `suspend_devices_and_enter`, `suspend_finish` (thaw, `filesystems_thaw`, `PM_POST_SUSPEND`, `pm_restore_console`), `console_resume_all` (`pr_flush(1000, true)`), upstream `musb_g_rx`/`rxstate`/`dma_controller_irq`, `mtk_wdt_probe` order, `CONFIG_HZ_100` |
| Fix02 physical evidence `out/cpu-final-fix02-physical-qualification/20260929T152328Z/` | `x-rtc-retained.json`: stage `DEVICES_RESUMING`, ring of balanced phase-8 pairs through `faux`, reset stamp `0x59325253`. `harness/` and `usb-retest/usb-loaded-stress.json`: ISR, DMA-interrupt and DMA-programming deltas. `x-slidle-radios-off/result.json`: `slow_reject_bus` and the clock mask. `harness/slidle-coordinator.json`: `busy_percent=100`, `burst_ms=780` before the wake |

## USB arithmetic (Fix02 receipts)

| Run | ISR Δ | DMA-IRQ Δ | RX + TX DMA programs Δ | Upper bound if every packet costs two interrupts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Boot 1 (harness) | 1155 | 597 | 512 + 99 = 611 | 1222 |
| Boot 3 (retest) | 916 | 473 | 407 + 81 = 488 | 976 |

The observed interrupt totals stay below the per-packet bound. A stuck source
would have added at least 513 interrupts on top of it. The 513 counted in one
10-ms jiffy were therefore legitimate per-packet work, about 12 MB/s.

Only behavior corroborated by the MT6582 BSP and the physical Y2 receipts was
used. No adjacent-SoC constant was imported. Whether the loader preserves
`WDT_STATUS` until the kernel reads it, and which resume call stalls, are
physical questions for the next owner run. Synthetic tests establish only the
software contract.
