Started 2026-09-26. ACTIVE: the owner installed Physical 01; its exact identity
and initial regression gate are verified. Work continues as the **hardware
capability ceiling campaign**, with broad investigation and coherent batches.
This is not a completed platform qualification or a hardware ceiling freeze.
[Current audit](../planning/roadmap-gap-audit.md#hardware-capability-ceiling-entry--2026-09-26).
[Master issue table](PLATFORM-V1-PHYSICAL-ISSUES.md).

Continuation through receipt `49`: matched library and separated SFTP
measurements are complete; the bounded GPT6/13 MHz/PPI29 test passes on all four
cores. A temporary fixed Reborn app resolves the native PCM-name contract bug;
owner confirms clean AirPods audio and working play/pause. Original app/session
were restored, then normal reboot returned taint 0 and clean storage.
The host lost USB during staged suspend. **Recovered persistent evidence now
shows freezer/devices/platform/processors returned**, including CPU3/2/1
shutdown/restart; USB overflow and later radio timeout invalidate full restore.
The owner's fresh Power Menu reboot restores pinned USB SSH, unchanged Physical
01, taint 0, clean filesystem counters and health on boot `fffb5ac5`.
Core/SPM entry and deep wake remain unproven. See the [ceiling report](PLATFORM-V1-HARDWARE-CEILING.md)
and [Hardware Batch 2 audit](../planning/roadmap-gap-audit.md#hardware-batch-2-build-admission--2026-09-26)
for corrected evidence, failure handling and the coherent build boundary.

[Hardware 02 candidate](PLATFORM-V1-HARDWARE-02.md) is built and release-validated
from Linux `76bc822` / Reborn `95747e0`, with the exact installed Physical 01
pair retained as fallback. It is ready for one preserving owner flash, not yet
installed or physically qualified. Receipts `50`–`52` additionally confirm
normal DNS and RTC UTC write/read/ticking; transient Wi-Fi observer readiness,
RTC retention and all new batch modes remain open.

## Physical 01 regression baseline — 2026-09-26

Fresh pinned USB SSH at 18:42 UTC identifies build
`Y2LINUX-PLATFORM-V1-PHYSICAL-01`, Linux `198fa7c`, Reborn `feb530f`,
candidate.3 / rootfs platform-v1.3, and kernel
`6.18.0-y2linux-platform-v1-physical-01`. Complete running versions JSON equals
the candidate metadata below. Boot ID is
`4991ba2c-0571-4649-9f7c-9e0318abb952`; no whole installed-image readback is claimed.

Private raw receipts live in
`out/platform-v1-hardware-ceiling/20260926T184237Z-physical01/`.
The [ceiling report](PLATFORM-V1-HARDWARE-CEILING.md) tracks measured limits,
remaining experiments and batch admission. Earlier sections below describe the
preceding Telemetry 01 boot and historical handoff, not the current installation.

| Regression gate | Physical 01 evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Boot, root/data, recovery access | Normal boot, separate rw ext4 root/data, fsck stages complete, pinned USB SSH maintained; root/data/clean replacement SD error counters all zero through receipt `14`. |
| Kernel and storage safety | Taint 0; no captured MMC CRC/timeout or filesystem corruption signature. Protected areas unchanged. |
| eMMC | Actual IOS eight bits, 13 MHz, legacy, 3.3 V. Guarded O_DIRECT sequential/random writes and verified reads pass; large sequential read/write approximately 10.64/10.65 MB/s (`03`). This is a baseline, not the eMMC ceiling. |
| SD | Owner confirms a different known-good card. Actual IOS four bits, 13 MHz, legacy, 3.3 V. Three guarded direct-I/O passes verify every read; large sequential read 5.87–5.89 and write 5.52–5.81 MB/s (`10`). The card has a small ext4 test filesystem; no resize/reformat. |
| Wi-Fi | WPA2-PSK/CCMP, DHCP, ordinary checksummed DNS through router and public resolver, NTP and bidirectional TCP work (`02`, `13`). Three local TCP repeats reach 45.15–45.60 Mb/s receive and 46.35–46.56 Mb/s transmit. Reconnect/coexistence remain separate gates. |
| USB | High-speed ECM/PIO, pinned SSH retained. Three TCP repeats reach 39.56–39.65 Mb/s receive and 46.56–46.66 Mb/s transmit. Uploads show 592–611 sender retransmissions per measured run; investigate rather than declare a ceiling. |
| Reborn/display | Owner confirms visible menu. Mali400/EGL rendering active; GPU clock observed 500.5 MHz and runtime power suspended with screen off. |
| Wired S16 | Direct hardware S16_LE stereo at 44.1 and 48 kHz: one minute each and six more rate switches, all rc=0, no reported XRUN; owner confirms both channels clean without clicks/dropouts (`09`). First segment overlapped SD load; longer Reborn qualification remains. |
| Bluetooth | Bonded/trusted/connected AirPods, actual SBC/S16 stereo 48 kHz, approximately three minutes of fixture playback, zero write/recovery errors; owner hears clean tones (`07`). Direct-fixture play/pause failed; later fixed Reborn playback/control passes by owner report (`29`), with trace limitation recorded separately. |
| CPU/memory/thermal | Four online cores, 598/747.5/1040 MHz OPPs, readable frequency/idle/thermal telemetry; 952288 KiB MemTotal and readable Reborn PSS. No new clock/voltage policy. |

Physical 01 is the working regression baseline. This promotion accepts the
observed width and checked-network repairs; it does not close outstanding
AVRCP, USB retransmission, timer, power, lifecycle or endurance qualification.
No higher storage clock is enabled before source/controller/card evidence and
repeated data-integrity checks justify that specific mode.

## Fix Batch 1 candidate handoff (historical)

Package: `out/y2linux-platform-v1-physical-01-candidate/`.
Handoff status was **IMAGE_VALIDATED_PHYSICAL_PENDING**. The owner has since
installed it and supplied both wired and AirPods listening observations above.
The agent has not flashed the device.

| Identity | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Linux build source | `198fa7cfd54a93826b54e3c0c4fab4d32e84acec` |
| Reborn build source | `feb530fae2cdf785c764d619e8df22798c8e524c` |
| Build / release | `Y2LINUX-PLATFORM-V1-PHYSICAL-01` / `1.0.0-candidate.3` |
| Kernel / rootfs | `6.18.0-y2linux-platform-v1-physical-01` / `2025.02.18-platform-v1.3` |
| BOOTIMG, 6,768,640 bytes | `f3309fd98e204da9013636c67a3cff9ab359cf92eae6f320d8c536853115a151` |
| Y2ROOT, 536,870,912 bytes | `e21ee81570a1beef7ea007bb992abcebfb78992686c66124aa3b0f357fcb2840` |
| Fallback BOOTIMG | `f7b4a950a0504a411ad72db0aac9398f04dc1ccabd6a6a0a3a7fdab198ca2622` |
| Fallback Y2ROOT (current Telemetry 01) | `4a8e520946ad1aaa00df46e9f302463341e4408bba063f43728b8cb8f68bb092` |

One preserving scatter selects BOOTIMG and ANDROID only; Y2DATA is retained.
The package's `install.md` is specific to this initialized device and replaces
the generic historical first-install text. Its `fallback/` holds the verified
current pair, and `sources/` contains both build-commit bundles and exact batch
diffs from campaign entry (`e88d044` Linux / `9125788` Reborn).

Final validation: 179 Reborn host tests; locked production groups 2/58/68/39,
with three explicit environment skips all covered by native host receipts;
eight ARM/QEMU application checks; 20 installed ARM module imports, SQLite
WAL/checkpoint, defaults, null-ALSA constraint query and actual 1k ARM benchmark;
three installed ARM SFTP protocol/reserve/interruption checks. Kernel/config,
device tree/rescue/BOOTIMG, root ext4/tar agreement, exact image/fallback hashes
and preserving manifest pass. License inventory covers 102 selected packages;
the known Buildroot/Bootlin/local-package collection limitations are retained.
Byte-identical rebuilding is not claimed. Raw intermediate failures are retained
privately; no failed attempt is substituted for a final passing receipt.

The handoff's requested owner installation and first regression measurements
have now occurred. Continue the ceiling campaign from that verified installation.

## Exact starting target

Authenticated owner USB SSH, existing key/pin, captured 14:31:42 UTC:

| Field | Running value |
| --- | --- |
| Boot ID | `09de0586-278c-4d37-a68f-17ac9952740c` |
| Kernel | `6.18.0-y2linux-platform-v1-candidate-01` |
| Kernel/base source | `d04b95aaff713edf943042d97a4c6134ca19fc24` |
| Platform userspace | `814c2f3470566021c1a9c43037fd868de8b2df9c` |
| Reborn | `155608393f6acfc6657f2f2e23cd07d0533479c6` |
| Platform/rootfs | `1.0.0-candidate.2` / `2025.02.18-platform-v1.2` |
| Build | `Y2LINUX-PLATFORM-V1-TELEMETRY-01` |
| Platform API/layout/data schema | 1 / 1 / 1 |
| Root/data | `/dev/mmcblk0p5` → `/`, `/dev/mmcblk0p7` → `/data`, separate rw ext4 |

Complete versions JSON matches the local Telemetry 01 package. It differs from
`out/y2linux-platform-v1-candidate/` as expected from the later installation;
both comparisons are retained. No whole installed-image hash claim. Exact uname,
cmdline, mounts, releases, status, capabilities, full health and boot evidence
are in private receipts `00`–`05`.

Raw evidence is private and ignored under
`out/platform-v1-physical-bringup/20260926T143142Z-census/`. Each command receipt
records host UTC, elapsed time, command, exit code and separate stdout/stderr.
Device wall time is inaccurate; boot ID plus monotonic counters bind results.
Passwords, keys, bonds, calibration and NVRAM must never enter public receipts.

## Initial safety and observation

Kernel taint 0; both ext4 error counters 0; no retained panic/Oops/WARN-stack or
filesystem I/O corruption signature. Warnings include timer/cache descriptions,
temporary deferred probes, PMIC LED node, hardening configuration, legacy p8
clipping, unsupported regulator get_mode and HCI feature quirk. They require
individual disposition, not an automatic campaign stop.

At 14:32 UTC CPU/PMIC die readings are 54.4/50.391°C. Battery is present and
Charging at 3.854443 V; SDP online, configured charge current 450000 µA and
source allocation 500000 µA. These are not measured pack/input current or pack
temperature. Retained charge/hold history will be analyzed with workload/context
limits. Owner screen/case-temperature observation requested.

Status returns in 2.695 s including SSH; full health in 3.475 s. Health is
DEGRADED due to DNS; SD is not mounted and Bluetooth is off. Query success alone
does not qualify the corresponding hardware functionality.

## Campaign controls

Ordinary failures are recorded and independent work continues. Global stops:
unsafe panic/Oops, filesystem corruption, protected-partition access, repeated
uncontrolled reboot, dangerous charger/battery/heat, lost recovery, or destructive
writes outside dedicated test areas. Scratch writes stay within guarded dedicated
directories. No manual flash, OTA apply, full reset, card swap/surprise removal or
unattended power/suspend run happens without its required owner action/approval.

## Broad census findings

Owner confirms main menu and normal case warmth. Current Reborn/ALSA are paused/
closed; no audio fixture has yet played. GPU and AFE runtime status are suspended.
Audio constraints accept stereo S16/44.1 and S16/48; wider combinations reject.
BlueZ/BlueALSA/reconnect services exist, adapter off, no peer/PCM. OTA is Idle.
The source inventory truthfully contains SBC only; Auto has no qualified codec.

Fresh WPA2-PSK/CCMP association, DHCP address/default route and 3/3 router ping
replies (mean 1.709 ms) work. Router and external-resolver DNS time out; libc
returns EAI_AGAIN. The driver advertises fixed generic TX checksum offload but
never enables its adapter/firmware checksum flags. In four alternating bounded
queries to the same router, normal UDP checksum requests time out twice;
socket-local SO_NO_CHECK diagnostic requests receive valid matching two-answer
DNS responses in 25.1 and 4.2 ms. This isolates the checksum path without changing
network configuration or providing a production bypass. The source repair must
restore normal checked traffic. Linux's [checksum-offload contract](https://docs.kernel.org/networking/checksum-offloads.html)
requires completion of CHECKSUM_PARTIAL, or software fallback. Raw receipts `10`
and `13` retain exact probes. NTP/TLS remain unready on the installed candidate.

Both actual MMC ios snapshots confirm one-bit legacy 13 MHz at 3.3 V. The SD
card enumerates and blkid identifies FAT32, but supplies no UUID, so the platform
refuses to mount it. Card contents/identity have not been modified. Root/data
remain clean. The installed 16-MiB storage benchmark records a 4-KiB buffered
sequential write at 0.498 MB/s including final fdatasync, then fails EINVAL at
cache advice: CONFIG_ADVISE_SYSCALLS is disabled. No read result is claimed from
that run. A separate guarded O_DIRECT diagnostic is being used for real media
I/O; cached rates will not be presented as bus throughput.

The 30.506-second screen-off idle sample (`09`, Wi-Fi connected, charging,
Bluetooth off) shows 7.50% aggregate CPU busy (about 30% of one core), 640 context
switches/s, 477 interrupts/s and 3.77 new processes/s. Frequency residency:
598 MHz 74.34%, 747.5 MHz 1.38%, 1040 MHz 24.29%. WFI wall-time residency spans
87.93–93.65% across four cores. Periodic broadcast operates at HZ100; all local
timers report nohz=0/highres=0. HIGH_RES_TIMERS is disabled, but enabling it
alone cannot repair this: tick_switch_to_oneshot rejects nonfunctional dummy
local clockevents. A supported per-CPU clockevent/wake path is still required. Load includes
blocked charger ADC and supplicant kalIoctl waits, so load average is not CPU
utilization. Collection itself is included and needs a lower-overhead comparison.
Reborn RSS is 22204 KiB/16 threads; PSS is unavailable because PROC_PAGE_MONITOR
is disabled. No memory-growth or thermal-envelope conclusion yet.

First storage-run safety observation: same boot, taint 0, ext4 errors 0/0,
CPU/PMIC 53.1/50.391°C, battery 3.859497 V and Charging. Current-boot retained
charger logs contain 301 observations, voltage 3.083642–3.898608 V, no nonzero
fault field and no hold/full event. Most of that history precedes this campaign
and includes offline charging/source changes; it is not a controlled charge-rate
or SOC calibration curve. Previous-boot tails contain hold/recharge behavior,
which must be analyzed separately rather than merged into this boot.

The following sections record the baseline, then the measured Fix Batch 1 work.
No new-image physical regression acceptance or endurance pass is claimed.

## eMMC measurements before fixes

Receipt `14-emmc-direct`: 16 MiB sequential region, 64 random operations per
size, O_DIRECT flag readback, aligned mmap buffers, exact deterministic data
readback, fdatasync after writes, dedicated guarded `/data/.y2-bench` scratch
removed on completion. MB/s is decimal; timing includes validation/guard costs.
Latency percentiles describe individual operations; throughput includes the final
write drain. Small sample counts make tail percentiles preliminary.

| Operation | MB/s | IOPS | Samples | p50 ms | p95 ms | p99 ms | max ms |

No corruption or direct-I/O readback mismatch was observed. 1-MiB transfers
approach the 1.625 MB/s raw one-bit/13-MHz ceiling. This identifies the current
transport limit; higher width/clock still needs board-specific evidence.

## SD integrity stop and isolation

At host 14:50 UTC, read-only `fsck.fat -n` on the unmounted card returns 1:
primary/backup byte 65 differs (dirty flag), root and boot-sector labels differ,
and the dirty bit is set. It reports 19 files/414 allocated clusters without a
reported crosslink or lost-chain error. Its final statement is "Leaving filesystem
unchanged". No repair was run. The volume serial is exactly zero, confirming why
blkid omits a UUID; the identity rejection is distinct from this integrity gate.

Device workloads are paused under the owner's filesystem-integrity stop rule.
Owner removal of the already-unmounted SD was requested to isolate the suspect
medium; internal ext4 errors remain zero and no internal integrity failure has
been observed. Source investigation continues while awaiting the action. Headphones
have been connected by the owner; no sound has been played yet.

Owner removed the unmounted card and confirmed the normal menu. Receipt `16`
confirms no mmcblk1, same boot, taint 0 and internal ext4 errors 0/0. Device work
resumed on internal storage; the removed card remains gated and unrepaired.
The connected headphone jack still reports off: DT intentionally omits the
codec interrupt while upstream jack reporting depends on that interrupt. This
is an observation gap, not evidence that the owner failed to connect the plug.

## Stock source investigation in progress

The retained hash-identified Y2 FM kernel provides concrete board data:
`msdc_drv_probe` reads platform_data at pdev+0x5c and data_pins at hw+0x14.
The identified mtk-msdc platform devices are 0xc09ac298 (id 0, hw 0xc09fe4b0,
8 data pins) and 0xc09ac3a0 (id 1, hw 0xc09fe450, 4 data pins). Host-function
fields are 0/eMMC and 1/SD respectively. One additional byte-pattern match is
code/driver data and is rejected, not treated as board configuration. Extracts
are private under `out/platform-v1-physical-bringup/stock-reference/`.
Stock/current SDC_CFG width encodings agree; the SD pinctrl group already owns
all six CMD/CLK/DAT pins. Production candidate DT now requests eight/four bits,
retaining 13 MHz, 3.3 V and legacy timing. The minimal first-boot DT stays at one
bit. CMD6 policy permits only SDR width encodings 0/1/2; DDR/strobe/timing/area
changes remain refused. The existing MMC core compares read-only EXT_CSD fields
after widening and can fall back to a narrower width. This is evidence-backed
implementation awaiting a new kernel and physical readback/error regression.

Stock generic_timer_register at 0xc095cbc0 requests per-CPU interrupt 29;
generic_timer_set_next_event writes CP15 CNTP_TVAL/CNTP_CTL. generic_timer_setup
calibrates against jiffies and does not simply assume CNTFRQ. Thus an actual
stock local-timer implementation exists. Current secure/nonsecure boot routing,
frequency and a bounded GPT-backed qualification/fallback must be reconciled
before activating a replacement clockevent. No timer or SPM sequence changed.

## SQLite and library baseline

Installed ARM `reborn-bench` through guarded platform scratch, exact Reborn schema,
scanner and UI; all sizes pass quick_check and exact track counts with zero scan
failures. Fixtures are tiny synthetic WAV files, not a representative compressed
music collection. WAL synchronous=NORMAL; cache is uncontrolled and reopening
is not a cold-storage measurement. All scratch files were removed.

The 10k/20k jobs take 126.7/304.1 seconds including all workloads and cleanup;
child CPU user+system is 55.6/120.3 seconds; peak child RSS 21816/33936 KiB.
Recorded endpoint CPU die reaches 57.2°C; internal ext4 counters stay zero and
kernel taint remains zero. No endurance/memory-growth claim follows from this.
Long WAL stalls implicate the constrained storage path. Listing latency scales
linearly, while indexed identity lookup stays around 0.1 ms, motivating a
separate exact-query/index A/B measurement before changing SQL.

Archived original-candidate host receipts provide context, not a matched-hardware
experiment (they do not embed host hardware/revision and have `scan: null`).
Their 1k/10k/20k population times are 2.533/26.407/51.552 ms versus this Y2's
88.648/7,689.380/20,229.702 ms. Page p50 is 0.186/1.191/2.767 ms on the host
versus 6.921/45.589/93.632 ms on Y2. At 20k, checkpoint is 0.764 ms versus
1,063.489 ms. Host success is therefore not a useful device latency budget;
the direct-I/O limit and exact device SQL A/B provide the actionable diagnosis.
Archived receipt location:
`out/y2linux-platform-v1-candidate/validation/host-library-before-after/`.

## Metadata and durability calls

Receipt `23-metadata`: 64 samples each, dedicated guarded scratch. Each sync
call follows a fresh 4-KiB write (file calls) or fresh create (directory call).
Individual latency excludes preparation/identity guards. Reported operations/s
includes those guards and preparation; it is harness throughput, not pure syscall
IOPS. MB/s is not applicable to stat/rename/delete/directory sync.

## Wired short playback and Bluetooth adapter

Owner connected wired headphones, confirmed readiness after quiet mixer readback,
and heard all six alternating three-second 44.1/48-kHz tones cleanly in both ears
with no clicks/pops/static/dropouts. Receipt `26-wired-rates` records six rc=0
aplay runs, RUNNING S16_LE stereo at each exact requested rate, advancing AFE
period counters, and closed PCM afterward. No underrun/XRUN was reported. Master
was -24 dB with -30 dBFS fixtures; initial -60 dB Master and disabled output were
restored. This is short direct S16/44.1 and S16/48/rate-switch evidence, not
sustained playback, analog precision or preserved-24-bit qualification.

Reborn Bluetooth on action succeeds (`25`), adapter powered, BlueZ and BlueALSA
owners stable, A2DP-source:SBC advertised, AVRCP target/controller registered.
No paired peer/PCM exists yet. The owner was asked to put a named headset into
pairing mode; no nearby unidentified device will be paired/trusted automatically.

## USB transfer baseline

Receipt `27` and `usb-transfer-summary.json`: authenticated pinned-key SFTP over
USB ECM, 64 MiB deterministic large file plus 128 × 4 KiB files. `put -f` requests
durable upload; the remote helper also fsyncs and hashes every file. All 129
remote hashes/sizes and all downloaded copies match. Guarded scratch is removed.
Large upload: 1.327 MB/s (50.56 s). Warm-cache large download: 5.727 MB/s (11.72 s).
Small durable upload: 0.112 MB/s (4.68 s); small download: 0.856 MB/s (0.61 s).
These include SSH/session overhead; warm-cache download is not an eMMC read rate.
No disconnection occurred. Manual reconnect/cable/PC sleep cycles are still pending.

## Measured query fix

Receipts `29`, `41`, `43` use the installed SQLite 3.53.4, exact current schema
and SELECT, 20k synthetic rows, guarded disposable database, 12 samples per case
and full result hashes. All variants preserve every returned row and quick_check.
Cached query comparisons isolate SQL work; they are not cold-storage rates.

| Query p50 | Original | Ordered browse index + direct predicates + small album index |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| page (64 rows) | 94.86 ms | 4.92 ms |
| first / last artist | 42.19 / 42.61 ms | 4.73 / 4.77 ms |
| first / last album | 38.77 / 38.02 ms | 1.46 / 1.43 ms |
| folder prefix | 59.42 ms | 4.91 ms |

An ordered partial index removes the full browse sort; direct bound predicates
permit artist seeks. A small partial album index permits album seeks with a
small result sort. It uses ~1.5 MB less than a second wide ordered index with
similar measured album latency. Allocated live database pages increase from
5,885,952 to 8,122,368 bytes. A 64-row same-title rewrite median rises from
0.77 to 2.58 ms (the wide alternative 3.78 ms); these are not durable transaction
or full scanner measurements. New ARM scanner/population/WAL regression remains
required. Schema stays v1 and old queries remain compatible; migration is
transactional and preserves offline/deleted state.

## AirPods bonding diagnosis

The owner identified AirPods Pro 2 and twice reported connection attempts. The
adapter shows ACL Connected, but Paired/Bonded remain false and BlueALSA has no
PCM. A Pair call earlier returned success and Reborn set Trusted, but only
General/DeviceID storage sections exist; no key content was exposed in reports.
A later Pair was AuthenticationRejected. The source completion handler omits
Connect entirely, leaving the sole automatic reconnect owner inhibited after
the explicit pair intent (PHY-013).

Receipt `34` traces a serialized explicit Connect diagnostic: missing link key,
IO Capability Reply **No Bonding / MITM required**, then remote **Pairing Not
Allowed (0x18)**. BlueZ Adapter1.Pairable is false after its 180-second timeout.
Linux 6.18 hci_io_capa_request_evt forces a non-bonding authentication value when
HCI_BONDABLE is clear, even for an initiating Pair. Reborn never opens Pairable
for Pair. This strongly supports PHY-014; a successful physical saved-bond trace
is still required.

Standard temporary Pairable windows (`40`, `45`) enabled the flag while awaiting
the owner's new pairing action; no Pair occurred during the captured windows.
The 600-second quiet SSH channel hit configured Dropbear `-I 600`; receipt `47`
reconnects successfully on the same boot with taint 0, ext4 errors 0/0 and die
temperatures CPU/PMIC 56.5/52.7°C. Pairable had expired automatically. Receipt
`48` restores the original 180-second timeout, stops the identified orphan
monitor, captures private traces and removes its dedicated RAM scratch. Future
long collectors must emit progress before the SSH idle deadline. This was not
a device reboot or lost recovery path.

Fix Batch 1 gives an explicit Pair a 90-second daemon-enforced Pairable window,
checks Paired and Bonded before setting Trusted, restores previous adapter policy,
then sends Connect while retaining the platform operation lease. Failure, cancel
and timeout restore policy; asynchronous failures reach Reborn status. A private
D-Bus test covers missing bonds, authentication rejection, successful ordering
and cancellation. y2-bt-reconnect remains the sole automatic connection owner.
No SBC, AVRCP, reconnect or coexistence pass is claimed yet.

Receipts `49`/`50` again show Connected=true with Paired=false, Bonded=false
and no PCM. The UI independently collapses Connected into Paired, hiding
Pair & Connect and enabling Use for Audio without a transport. The same batch
now carries explicit paired/bonded/connected/audio-ready presentation fields;
an incomplete link retains Pair & Connect, and audio selection requires the
observed playback PCM. Regression cases include a transport disappearing while
the menu is open. A bounded retry window (`51`) was closed (`52`, Pairable=false)
when the owner requested postponing headphone testing. No further pairing or
listening action is currently requested.

## Fix Batch 1 source and host gate

The [admission audit](../planning/roadmap-gap-audit.md#physical-fix-batch-1-admission--2026-09-26)
refreshes every coverage area before implementation. Besides storage/SQL/BT:
disable uninitialized firmware checksum offload, enable ADVISE_SYSCALLS and
PROC_PAGE_MONITOR, annotate unavailable cache advice without claiming cold reads,
bind capabilities to installed release identity, and mark jack observation null
until codec IRQ qualification. No charger current, voltage, trip, SOC/shutdown,
timer/SPM, VBUS or audio format expansion is included.

Current-source Reborn workspace: 179 tests pass after the UI regression. Platform targeted suite: 84
pass, one emitted-DT case pending actual ARM artifact (not silently accepted).
The initial standalone connectivity test invocation lacked its documented
PYTHONPATH; the corrected invocation passes. New meaningful cases cover every
filter combination/migration, Bluetooth failure/cleanup and unavailable-vs-I/O
fault cache advice. Full production artifact tests, ARM build and physical
regression remain required before candidate acceptance.

The preserving system packager now accepts an explicit, separately validated
Telemetry 01 root-overlay receipt for fallback. It checks the exact old BOOTIMG,
root hash/size, on-image versions, filesystem label/UUID/cleanliness, kernel
provenance and unchanged layout/data schema. The full production manifest still
owns geometry; an overlay is not promoted to a full release manifest. An actual
ext4 fixture verifies acceptance and nine mismatched input cases. The retained
current root (`4a8e520946ad1aaa00df46e9f302463341e4408bba063f43728b8cb8f68bb092`)
passes this check. This prepares a coherent fallback; no flashing is performed.

Packaging the retained base exposed a checksum-inventory validator defect: it
excluded every file named SHA256SUMS, including nested evidence receipts that
the package correctly lists. All their hashes already verified. Correct the
writers/validators to exclude only the top-level self-inventory; nested-receipt
acceptance, tampering and omission now have a regression test. The original
base package remains unchanged and validates with this correction.

The first isolated ARM pass compiled kernel and rootfs, then artifact assembly
stopped because cache symlinks pointed outside the device-isolated build mount.
The worktree now has local source/download cache directories. Inspection also
found the early regulatory archive still pinned to 2026.05.30 while locked
Buildroot 2025.02.18 installs 2026.09.03. Align the early archive to Buildroot's
reviewed SHA256 and require byte-identical signed databases in early/root
userspace. This is a packaging consistency correction, not an explanation for
the independently isolated Wi-Fi checksum fault. Resume the full build from
the final committed source pair, including the additional UI fix.

## Additional bounded decoder measurements

Receipts `53`/`54`, unchanged boot: all 25 decoder fixtures pass, including
24-bit/96-kHz input, six artwork cases and three corrupt/truncated cases. ALSA
stays closed. At each existing cpufreq maximum, three warm-cache repetitions
pass; residency confirms the imposed caps. No OPP or voltage is changed.

| Maximum | Suite median | 1-s FLAC median | 0.25-s 24/96 FLAC median, resampled to 48 kHz |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 598 MHz | 1,885 ms | 56 ms | 41 ms |
| 747.5 MHz | 1,531 ms | 48 ms | 33 ms |
| 1,040 MHz | 1,142 ms | 34 ms | 25 ms |

These short fixtures show substantial decoder headroom at 598 MHz (24/96 input
about 6.1 times real time). They do not qualify sustained playback, EQ/crossfade,
radio coexistence or preserved-24 output. Original schedutil and 1,040-MHz
maximum are restored; internal ext4 errors and taint remain zero. A governor
policy change needs end-to-end workload evidence, not only this microbenchmark.

Receipt `55` exercises the actual installed export flow, including online SQLite
backup: 2,296-byte archive, three member hashes verified, one-track database
quick_check passes. A hash-identical private copy is saved on the host. Network
credentials, bonds and private keys are excluded. No reset or library deletion
occurred. Receipt `56` confirms the same boot, zero taint/ext4 errors, restored
governor/max, closed PCM and closed Pairable window; no btmon process remains.

## Remaining physical and evidence gates

These are campaign work still outstanding, not waived features or completed
qualification. Baseline measurements and old narrow passes remain tied to the
installed Telemetry 01 identity; the new candidate requires broad regression.

| Boundary | Exact next evidence or measurement | Reason for gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New boot/recovery/storage | Owner installs the paired images; verify identity, eight-bit ios, scratch readback/hashes at all sizes, metadata/sync and error deltas; retain exact current fallback | Kernel/storage changes require real board validation before acceptance |
| SD | Owner supplies a clean card or explicitly approves repair; establish stable CID/partition identity for zero-serial media, then filesystem/mount/busy-unmount/swap tests | Removed FAT medium has metadata inconsistencies; current UUID-only service rejects it independently |
| Wi-Fi | On repaired kernel, normal DNS/TCP/NTP, timing/throughput, reconnect and wrong-password/AP/DHCP/DNS failure cases | Diagnostic SO_NO_CHECK success does not qualify ordinary traffic or service recovery |
| SBC/AVRCP/coexistence/codecs | Owner resumes AirPods pairing/listening; prove Paired+Bonded+Trusted, A2DP PCM and actual SBC, headset controls/metadata/restarts; then concurrent Wi-Fi | ACL-only Connected is insufficient. Optional encoders remain disabled until SBC is physically stable |
| CPU/display/memory/thermal | Full app playback, 24/96 downsampling, EQ/crossfade, scan and transfers, screen on/off; new PSS plus frequency/idle/wakeup/XRUN and temperature series | Short decoder fixtures establish headroom only; no sustained power or memory-growth claim |
| Timer/deeper idle | Reconcile stock PPI29 physical-timer frequency/security/routing; exact Y2 deep-idle PCM/PMIC variant, UART/CIRQ/context/timer entry/exit and clock exclusions, bounded fallback | Stock timer calibration differs from a simple CNTFRQ assumption. Full-suspend PCM is not deep-idle proof; WFI stays enabled |
| Deep suspend | After candidate recovery/storage checks, owner-present pm_test stages including CPU3/2/1 restoration, then Power wake with identical boot ID; RTC alarm later | GPU-01 failed before SPM entry on the wrong CPU3 ACK bit; corrected masks need physical retest before actual sleep |
| Charging/SOC/low battery | External USB meter under identified source, idle/screen/playback voltage/load series; identify pack and BATON/ISENSE wiring/offset/resistor; supervised safe charge/discharge/rest curves | Stock FG current/coulomb paths are stubs, temperature provider returns 25°C, and 68-mΩ sense assumption is not board calibration. USB input current is not pack current; no defensible SOC or shutdown reserve yet |
| RTC/time | Network synchronization after DNS repair, RTC write/read, then owner reboot/power-cycle retention; alarm only in controlled suspend | RTC ticks but carries a 2022 date; current system release-floor time is not synchronized time |
| USB device/host | Owner cable and PC sleep/wake cycles for device mode; board connector ID/role wiring, VBUS switch/limit and safe source topology before any host-mode activation | MUSB host capability and stock B-device observations do not prove safely powered USB host hardware |
| Wired/high-resolution output | Longer direct S16/48 switching/playback and app profile regression; for S32, exact MT6582 DL1 fetch/packing/interconnect evidence plus low-bit DMA/I2S capture; then clock-family measurements | 32-bit I2S slots and CS43131 codec capability do not establish preserved 24-bit data or 88.2/96-kHz AFE clocks |
| OTA/reset/endurance | After physical core regression, signed package check/staging; explicit owner approval for root apply/rescue/readback/health and failed-app rollback. Scoped reset on safe state, then approved long workloads/cycles | Export is measured; updater apply/rollback, reset and long unattended power/suspend are separate unperformed gates |

The detailed retained [hardware boundaries](../knowledge/platform-v1-hardware-gates.md),
[battery acquisition](../knowledge/m4-battery-acquisition.md) and
[GPU-01 failure](../hardware-evidence/2026-09-18-gpu01/README.md) remain primary
local evidence for these experiments. No charger-limit, deeper-idle, suspend,
VBUS, watchdog or wider-output activation is included in Fix Batch 1.
