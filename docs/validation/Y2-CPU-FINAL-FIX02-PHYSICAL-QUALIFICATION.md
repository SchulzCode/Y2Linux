# Y2 CPU Final Fix02 physical qualification — 2026-09-29

<!-- knowledge-base-scope: historical-validation-receipt; baseline02-sync 2026-10-03 -->

> **Historical exact-image receipt.** This report retains its named Fix image
> and dated result. It does not describe Baseline02 or negate the newer bounded
> UART01 C1/C2/C3 passes. See [Baseline02](Y2-BASELINE-02.md)
> and [latest CPU-idle hardware proof](Y2-CPU-C3-UART-PHYSICAL.md).

**Verdict: FAIL for acceptance as the normal Y2 CPU platform; the awake CPU
platform is substantially qualified.** Timers, hotplug, QoS, thermal authority,
MMC runtime clock gating, automatic core parking, PWRAP readiness and 1196/1300
MHz voltage DVFS pass on the device. The SRAM journal passes its awake self-test
and warm-reboot retention, and every staged PM level passes on the same boot.
Three defects remain: SLIDLE is refused by one bus-DCM register predicate,
loaded USB upload still ends in a terminal IRQ storm, and full RTC deep suspend
returns from SPM but resets 30 s later, after device resume and before
`pm_suspend` exit. No implementation source was changed, nothing was built or
flashed, no history was rewritten and nothing was pushed.

This supersedes the corresponding rows of the
[Fix01 physical report](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX01-PHYSICAL-QUALIFICATION.md). The
[Fix02 receipt](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX02.md) and [source ledger](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX02-SOURCES.md)
remain software provenance. PASS applies to the bounded observed behavior;
PARTIAL is incomplete evidence; NOT_TESTED never means a hardware pass.

## Identity and evidence

Installed identity matched the candidate manifest before the first test and on
every later boot:

| Field | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| Y2Linux runtime / Reborn runtime | `1a1a6693dcd82f62daecd4c1491ef512823a86c5` / `77cf83e09a18f82a867040e72d35b6e70b26fa85` |
| Kernel / rootfs | `6.18.0-y2linux-cpu-final-fix02` / `2025.02.18-platform-v1.8` |
| Release / build | `1.0.0-cpu-final-fix02-candidate.1` / `Y2LINUX-CPU-FINAL-FIX02` |
| Host Linux / Reborn HEAD | `5437b8f86fbc` (documentation continuation) / `77cf83e09a18` |

| Boot | ID | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `d83cfbde-3c9d-45b8-9b87-3a4a81af4766` | identity, harness awake checks, first USB fault, self-test |
| 2 | `cc90dc77-9e9c-44e6-ab72-b5b2e24652d3` | intended warm reboot (retention); regressions, MMC, SLIDLE, DVFS, matrix, staged PM, RTC attempt |
| 3 | `c3ce3cfb-48ef-473a-88af-f0f83558aa15` | RGU backstop warm reset after RTC wake; retained capture, USB retest |
| 4 | `6bb70fad-29a7-4a8e-a1a1-b69884434127` | ordinary reboot over Wi-Fi to recover the terminal USB fault; final state |

Private evidence: `out/cpu-final-fix02-physical-qualification/20260929T152328Z/`
(restricted). It holds the unchanged harness run (`harness/`), every
supplementary remote program with stdout/stderr/exit/duration/UTC (`x-*/`),
the reused harness `Run.suspend()` receipts (`suspend/`), device-side staged-run
directories, raw measurement snapshots, SRAM records, USB fault snapshots,
`qualification-summary.json` and `SHA256SUMS`. No keys, bond secrets, NVRAM or
calibration were exported.

The harness ran unchanged as
`qualify-cpu-fix02.py --run --host y2 --wifi-host y2-owner-wifi --allow-warm-reboot`.
The Wi-Fi alias came from a session-local SSH config, as in Fix01. It uses the
pinned device host key and a temporary key-only dropbear on `wlan0` started over
USB. The listener was lost at each new boot and is gone at the end. The harness
stops before suspend when any awake check fails. Its QoS and coordinator
verdicts failed for harness reasons (below). Independent phases therefore
continued through session-local scripts that reuse the harness helpers and its
own `Run.suspend()` and `usb_stress()`.

## Timers, hotplug, QoS, thermal — PASS (regression gate)

GPT6 control `0x31` running; GPT4 `gpt4_sole_owner` broadcast (`y2-gpt4-broadcast`);
admission `prepared_13mhz`, calibration 26000/26006/26000; CNTFRQ 13000000 on
all CPUs, error 0; PPI29 `arch_timer` advances on all four CPUs; clocksource
`arch_sys_counter`; all local events `arch_sys_timer`; `hrtimer_interrupt` and
oneshot broadcast; hres 1 and nohz 1 per CPU with stopped ticks observed.
100 requested 1-ms sleeps: medians 1.09 ms on every CPU, p95 ≤ 1.133 ms. Nine
individual CPU1–3 re-onlines plus 4→1→4 completed; taint 0. Identical on boots 3/4.

All eight workload classes were accepted with their floors (Idle/PlaybackNormal
0, PlaybackHeavy/Interactive/ArtworkDecode/LibraryScan 747.5 MHz,
NetworkTransfer/Maintenance 598 MHz). Overlap, renewal, expiry and killed-child
cleanup work. The cpufreq cooling device at max capped the policy at 598 MHz
despite a live PlaybackHeavy lease (restored to 0). Real input: Back key →
Interactive lease after 22 ms, lasting ≈274 ms; click-wheel likewise; screen-off
drops Interactive immediately and wheel input while dark adds none. Real
producers observed: PlaybackNormal, PlaybackHeavy, Interactive, LibraryScan,
NetworkTransfer, Maintenance. C1 WFI usage/residency advances; rejected 0.

The harness QoS FAIL is a harness defect: it injects KEY_UP (103) into
"Y2 navigation buttons", which Reborn maps only for 28/158/105/106/164.

## MMC runtime clock gating — PASS (storage), with one media-lifecycle defect

`y2_runtime_pm` for eMMC (`11230000.mmc`) and SD (`11240000.mmc`) reports
`gated=1` at rest, suspends/resumes balanced, `retained` equal to resumes,
`restored=0`, `last_mismatch=0x0` and `error=0`. The only refusals are
`refused_request` (a pending request, the intended retry). DMA, controller, FIFO
and interrupt refusals are all 0. CCF shows `y2-msdc0`/`y2-msdc1` gates with
enable/prepare 0, hardware N. The harness 1-MiB eMMC and 64-KiB SD checks pass.
A further 8 × 1 MiB eMMC and 8 × 512 KiB SD rounds each wrote, fsynced, dropped
caches, observed the host re-gated, then read back. All 16 SHA-256 matches
passed. ext4 error counters stayed 0, mounts stayed rw, and there were no MMC
CRC/timeout/reset lines.

**Defect (non-CPU, SD media lifecycle):** `media.inventory()` identifies the SD
by the kernfs inode number and ctime of `/sys/class/block/mmcblk1*`. Dropping
caches evicts those kernfs inodes, and the recreated inodes compare as a changed
inventory. The readiness loop then unmounted and remounted `/media/sd` twice
during the test. One scratch file survived its `unlink` because the unlink ran
against the momentarily empty mountpoint. Test-provoked here, but ordinary
memory pressure reclaims kernfs inodes too. No data was damaged.

## SLIDLE — FAIL (single identified predicate)

With radios on, the clock-blocker mask while parked is `0x100800` (APDMA +
BTIF, the CONSYS transport). That is legitimate while Wi-Fi/BT run.
**MSDC0/MSDC1 are no longer persistent blockers**; they appear only transiently.

With radios runtime-off, screen off and no forced topology/frequency, the
coordinator parked naturally. The clock mask read **0** for 200 s, yet entries
stayed 0: every attempt then failed `slow_reject_bus` (0 → 20809). In
`y2_ccf_slow_idle()` that is `readl(TOPCKGEN+4) != 0x0f`. `dormant_preflight`
reads the same register as **`bus=0x0`** on this board. Stock `bus_dcm_enable`
writes `0x8f` and its disable clears bit 7, with no inherited-value check. The
Y2 predicate assumes an inherited `0x0f` that this boot chain never sets. This
is the same class of mismatch as Fix01's PWRAP `0x1ff`/`0x7f`. Nothing was
overridden. Attempts/entries 61924/0, restore failures 0, broken N.

## Automatic core parking — PASS; one attribution defect

Harness 240-s silent screen-off window: CPU3, CPU2, CPU1 powered off at
546.2/551.3/556.5 s (5-s pacing) after eligibility, `parked_mask=0xe`, online
`0`, last reset none, load 161 mc, high-frequency 214‰. Display wake restored
`0-3` in 0.63 s. The radios-off run and the 330-s measurement parked the same
way and stayed parked. Manual offline/online during hotplug tests was never
claimed. The harness coordinator FAIL comes from requiring C2 entries in the
same verdict.

**Defect:** after a user wake the state shows `last_reset=burst reset_burst=1
pressure_restores=1 hold_ms=120000`. The wake's render burst is counted as a
pressure restore, which doubles the parking hold (up to 960 s, reset after ten
stable parked minutes). Frequent real wakes would delay parking.

## Screen-off CPU behavior — improved (CPU idle improvement, not battery)

| Screen-off idle | Fix01 (160 s) | Fix02 (330 s, parked) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU, % of four cores | 9.74 | **2.71** (CPU0 10.98 % busy) |
| Cores online | 4 | **1** |
| OPP % 598/747.5/1040/1196/1300 | 73.71/1.05/25.24/–/– | **85.10/2.46/2.57/1.03/8.84** |
| C1 % of four cores | 89.64 | 21.96 (87.8 % of CPU0; CPU1–3 powered off) |
| C2 / C3 | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 |
| IRQ/s | 391.49 | **171.43** |
| Context switches/s | 503.93 | **355.42** |
| Max CPU / PMIC °C | 51.8 / 51.561 | 50.2 / 48.052 |

Busy CPU time falls about 3.6×, IRQs 2.3×, context switches 1.4×. Measured in
the same configuration (radios on, USB attached, charging). Harness attribution
over 243 s: Reborn 8.19 s CPU, three long-lived platform Python daemons about
2.9 s each, y2-bt-reconnect 0.75 s. The harness `percent_of_one_core` field is
10× too large (harness defect). Dark bursts now reach 1300 MHz @ 1.25 V for
8.8 % of the time. No electrical power was measured.

## PWRAP / high OPP — PASS

`pwrap_readiness`: `mux=0x0 wrap_en=0x1 hiprio_arb_en=0x7f implemented=0x7f
wacs2_en=0x1 init_done2=0x1 live=ready last=ready`, DVFS slots
`0x21e:0x58/0x50/0x48`. Automatic admission `qualification_max_khz=1300000`,
bin Y, `voltage_fault=N`. `admission_error=1` is `freq_qos_update_request()`'s
positive "changed" return, i.e. success (cosmetic).

| OPP | Clock readback | Voltage readback | Selector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 598 / 747.5 / 1040 MHz | exact | 1.15 V | 0x48 |
| 1196 MHz | exact | **1.20 V** | 0x50 |
| 1300 MHz | exact | **1.25 V** | 0x58 |

Five cycles of 1040→1196→1300→1196→1040→598→1040 (30 steps) reached exact
clock/voltage every step, `last_error=0 first_error=0`. There is no tracefs, so
ordering was checked by a concurrent sampler on CPU3 (7796 frequency-then-voltage
pairs). No UP-direction violation occurred. The four (high clock, lower voltage)
pairs all fell 2 ms into DOWN steps, which is the read-order artifact expected
from clock-before-voltage. The intermediate (1196 MHz, 1.25 V) was observed.
Sampled evidence, not a hardware trace.

Four-worker SHA/zlib integrity: 1040 MHz 16647 iterations, 1196 MHz 18604, both
with 0 errors (peak 71.5 °C at 1196). At 1300 MHz, four workers reached the 75 °C
test guard in 16.8 s and were stopped. Two workers ran 5247 iterations with
0 errors (peak 64.5 °C). No voltage fault or fallback. The DT cpu-thermal trips
are the BSP 110 °C passive / 120 °C critical, so the natural trip is NOT_TESTED
under the new 1300-MHz ceiling. The cooling-device override passes.

## USB loaded transfer — FAIL, attributed

Wi-Fi observed before and after. Both runs (boots 1 and 3) lost USB in the
**first** 1-MiB upload round: 0 of 10 successful. Classification is IRQ storm,
`fault_reason=irq_overflow`, `rc=-75`, `irq_max_burst=513 > 512`. It is not a
power-read transient, not reconnect timing and not a DMA bus error:
`monitor_failures=0`, `reconnect_retries=0`, `dma_bus_errors=0×8`,
`irq_unexplained=0`.

Fault snapshots: boot 1 L1 `0x182/0xf` (RX pending), `rx=2/1e`, EP1 RXCSR
`0x0003` (RxPktRdy|FIFOFull, 512 B) with DMA channel 5 (`cntl=0x618`, EP1 RX)
complete. Boot 3 L1 `0x108/0xf` (DMA pending), `DMA_INTR=0x20` (channel 5), EP1
RXCSR `0x2003` (DMAReqEnab + RxPktRdy + FIFOFull). Both are the host→device EP1
OUT bulk path under Inventra DMA. An RX completion/next-packet condition keeps
re-asserting instead of being acknowledged and re-armed. The UI stayed alive and
the transfer mode fell back to PIO. The fault is terminal by design and has no
runtime recovery hook, so recovery was an ordinary reboot over Wi-Fi.

## SRAM diagnostics — PASS

Awake self-test: `result=pass`, sequences A=1/B=2, slot alternation, previous
record preserved, reset stamp written and restored, ring verified, phys
`0x10dc00` size `0x500`. One ordinary warm reboot: new boot ID,
`previous_valid=1 previous_sequence=2 previous_stage=SELFTEST_B
selftest_scratch=retained previous_ring=valid`. Retained records and the device
callback ring were also valid after the RTC backstop reset (below).

## Charger and staged suspend — PASS

With USB attached the charger was `charging_active` (CONSTANT_CURRENT). A staged
`devices` request produced `y2_charger_prepare_pm returns -16`, "not prepared for
power transition", clean `suspend exit`, same boot, taint unchanged, no WARN,
retained `failed_stage=DPM_PREPARED error=-16`, radios restored. The harness
marked it FAIL only because the charger's prepare entry had scrolled out of the
24-entry ring. After the owner unplugged USB: `no_usb`, NO_SOURCE, no refusal.

| Stage (30-s RGU backstop armed) | Result |
| --- | --- |
| freezer (USB attached) | PASS, rc 0, same boot, taint 0, journal COMPLETE |
| devices | PASS |
| platform | PASS |
| processors | PASS, CPU3/2/1 SPM power-off result 0 and back up |
| core | PASS |

## Full RTC suspend — FAIL; exact boundary

Pre-flight: RTC wakeup enabled, PMIC EINT25 → RTC IRQ20 / keys IRQ5, SPM
`SPM_CPU_SHUTDOWN_INFRA_RETAINED` not broken, backstop provider present.
Alarm +30 s armed 16:18:37 UTC; `kernel_suspend` 16:18:44; RTC due ≈16:19:07.
The device came back as a **new boot**; its kernel started ≈16:19:40, a reset
≈30 s after wake. This is the backstop period (`panic=0` would hang, not
reboot). The reset cause register is not decoded (`not_observed`).

Retained previous record (valid, sequence 138):
`reset_resume_entry=0x59325253` (the Y2 resume stamp, never observed in Fix01),
SPM wake `0x20`, `cirq=0x3`, `boot_vector=0x8047ca20`, PCM `0x8495e000`/596,
`wake_mask=0xfedfbfdb`, `rtc_enable=0x5`, last stage **`DEVICES_RESUMING`**,
failed stage none, error 0. The callback ring (cycle 101 = this attempt) ends
with balanced `phase=8` complete enter/leave pairs through the last device.
**SPM entry, RTC wake, Boot-ROM resume vector, CPU context restore, syscore,
secondaries and all device resume/complete callbacks happened.** The kernel then
did not reach `Y2_PM_EXIT` within the 30-s backstop. Userspace never logged
after resume and `y2-suspend` never wrote `RADIOS_RESTORING`.

The unmarked window is `resume_console` → `platform_resume_end` →
`suspend_finish` (thaw, `PM_POST_SUSPEND` notifiers, console restore). No mark
pings the backstop between `DEVICES_RESUMING` and `EXIT`. The exact stalled
call inside that window is not established. The harness start step also
misparsed `rtc-alarm`'s own JSON output and retried after the suspend had
already launched (harness defect; no effect on the device path).

| Test | Status |
| --- | --- |
| RTC deep wake / same boot | FAIL: SPM return proven; backstop reset before PM exit |
| Power wake | NOT_TESTED: RTC full resume not established |
| Five RTC cycles | NOT_TESTED |
| Post-resume restoration | NOT_TESTED; boots 3/4 are clean boots, not resumes |
| Watchdog resets | one intended backstop reset (converted a stall into retained evidence) |

## C3 DORMANT — NOT_TESTED (not eligible)

`dormant_preflight`: `unmet=topology,frequency,domains,clocks,bus`. It needs
one CPU, ≤747.5 MHz, domains `0xe0a` (CPUs, CONN, DISP) off, PERI blockers
`0x21e8ffd` / INFRA `0xa0a0` clear, and `bus=0x0f`. The last shares SLIDLE's
predicate. C3 stayed disabled (`disable=1`, `CPUIDLE_FLAG_OFF`); nothing was
forced.

## Intelligent CPU workload matrix

Direct /proc and cpufreq/cpuidle deltas; CPU and C1 normalized to four-core
capacity; OPP order 598/747.5/1040/1196/1300 MHz; voltage follows the OPP table
per readback. Observer overhead is included. Per-core values are in
`x-matrix/analysis.json`.

| Workload | CPU % | OPP % | Cores | C1/C2/C3 % | IRQ/s | Ctx/s | Max CPU/PMIC °C |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Screen-on idle (20 s) | 5.13 | 88.8/1.2/2.1/0.5/7.4 | 4 | 94.0/0/0 | 472 | 559 | 50.6/49.8 |
| Screen-off idle (330 s) | 2.71 | 85.1/2.5/2.6/1.0/8.8 | 1 | 22.0/0/0 | 171 | 355 | 50.2/48.1 |

| 4-core load 1040 / 1196 (25 s) | ~100 | fixed | 4 | – | – | – | 64.6/58.6, 71.5/63.3 |

Playback ran with fixture silence; zero-XRUN/fidelity was not re-certified.
Crossfade was set through the real UI and restored to 0. Playback leases keep
all cores online by design.

## Cleanup and owner actions

Final boot `6bb70fad…`: identity unchanged, four CPUs, schedutil 598–1300 MHz,
cooling 0, C3 disabled, crossfade 0, playback stopped, fixtures and scratch
files removed, original three library tracks present. Wi-Fi associated, CONSYS
calibrated with 0 errors, BT controller up, DSI connected, ALSA/GPU present,
Reborn health `ok`, root/data/SD rw, ext4 errors 0, taint 0. The temporary Wi-Fi
listener is gone. Device-side staged-run receipts remain in
`/data/system/platform/fix02-*` and are copied to private evidence. Reborn's
queue still lists the removed fixture entries.

Owner physical actions, exactly two:
1. Unplug USB (charging was active; required for devices+ stages).
2. Reconnect USB after the RTC backstop reset (Wi-Fi listener lost with the boot).

No Power press, shell command, log inspection or frequency selection was needed.

## Acceptance answers

## One coherent Fix03 correction batch

Scope: resume completion, bus-DCM baseline and EP1 RX DMA servicing. No CPU
architecture change.

1. **Resume completion.** Mark and ping the backstop at every step from
   `dpm_resume_end` to `Y2_PM_EXIT` (after resume, complete, `resume_console`,
   `platform_resume_end`, thaw and `PM_POST_SUSPEND`). Stamp ring entries with a
   monotonic ms value. Decode the RGU reset status into `boot.json`. Then take
   one RTC attempt to name the stalled call and fix that call only.
2. **Bus DCM.** Establish the source-backed baseline of TOPCKGEN+4 (Y2 reads
   `0x0`, stock clears only bit 7 on exit). Reconcile the SLIDLE and deep-idle
   predicates with it, as PWRAP was reconciled, keeping the verified write and
   exact restore.
3. **USB EP1 OUT.** Align RX DMA completion, DMA_INTR acknowledgement and
   RxPktRdy/DMAReqEnab re-arm for channel 5 with the MT6582/Inventra reference,
   using the two captured snapshots. Keep the storm guard terminal.
4. **Coordinator and media.** Exclude display/workload restores from
   pressure-hold escalation. Key SD inventory on stable identity (device
   number/CID), not kernfs inode/ctime.

Harness corrections, which do not affect the device: navigation key code,
separate parking and C2 verdicts, a warm reboot over the Wi-Fi fallback, the
attribution scale, charger refusal checked from `failed_stage`/dmesg,
`rtc-alarm` output captured, and no retry after a launch.
