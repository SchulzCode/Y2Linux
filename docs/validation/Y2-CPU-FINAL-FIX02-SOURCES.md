Retained sources were read without reacquiring ROM/recovery/calibration. New
bounded extracts and fetched BSP files are private in
`out/cpu-final-fix02/source/` with a SHA256 `manifest.json`, and are included
in the candidate's source collection. Fix01's ledger remains valid for timers,
GPT/CIRQ, SPM PCM and the RAM-console map.

RAM-console guard at 0xacce only rewrites on magic 0x43474244; its else-branch callee writes a DRAM argument block.

Only register behavior corroborated by at least two of the MT6582 BSP, the
retained Y2 binaries and a physical Y2 readback was used. No adjacent-SoC
constant was imported. The MT6582 arbiter field width follows from the BSP's
seven channels plus the physical 0x7f readback of a 0x1ff write; the MSDC
register image follows from the BSP map; the RGU backstop uses only the
existing upstream MT6582/MT6589 watchdog driver.

Source inspections establish register/software contracts. Synthetic tests
establish error handling. Only the next owner-controlled physical receipts can
establish actual gating, parking, voltage, wake and USB behavior.
