# CPU Final Fix 03 implementation and candidate receipt

Owner-authorized correction batch for the real-device failures recorded by the
[Fix02 physical qualification](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX02-PHYSICAL-QUALIFICATION.md)
(2026-09-29). This pass changes software and produces **one** preserving
candidate. It does not access or flash a Y2, and it restarts no architecture.
Every Fix02 physical pass is kept as a regression requirement: timers,
highres/NO_HZ, hotplug, QoS, thermal authority, WFI, MMC runtime gating,
automatic parking, 1196/1300-MHz DVFS, SRAM self-test/retention, staged PM and
charger refusal. Software tests are not physical passes. Sources are in the
[Fix03 ledger](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX03-SOURCES.md). The next run is prepared in
[Fix03 physical qualification](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX03-PHYSICAL-QUALIFICATION.md).
Admission is recorded in the
[Fix03 implementation boundary](../planning/roadmap-gap-audit.md#cpu-final-fix03-implementation-boundary--2026-10-01).

Starting Linux `19ab970` (Fix02 physical report commit); starting Reborn
`77cf83e09a18f82a867040e72d35b6e70b26fa85` (unchanged, no Reborn change needed).

## 1. Full-suspend resume completion: diagnostics first

**Evidence.** The retained record from the Fix02 RTC attempt shows the Y2
resume stamp (`0x59325253`), SPM wake `0x20`, the resume vector, and every
device resume/complete pair through `faux`. The last stage was
`DEVICES_RESUMING` with error 0. `Y2_PM_EXIT` was never written, and the RGU
backstop reset the board about 30 s after wake.

**What was missing.** The unmarked window was `dpm_resume_end` →
`console_resume_all` (which ends in a synchronous `pr_flush(1000, true)`) →
`platform_resume_end` → `suspend_finish` (thaw, `filesystems_thaw`,
`PM_POST_SUSPEND` notifiers, `pm_restore_console`). No mark pinged the
backstop there, and the ring had no time.

**Change.** Seven stages are appended, so old records still decode:
`DEVICES_RESUMED`, `CONSOLE_RESUMED`, `PLATFORM_ENDED`, `TASKS_THAWED`,
`FILESYSTEMS_THAWED`, `POST_SUSPEND_NOTIFIED`, `CONSOLE_RESTORED`. Each one
marks the record and pings the backstop. Device callbacks ping it too, so only
one call that makes no progress for the full period resets the board, not a
long but progressing phase. Ring entries now carry `local_clock()`
milliseconds. Every stage mark is also a ring entry (phase 254), interleaved
with the callback trail, so the last line names the last boundary reached.
Names keep a 16-byte tail. A Fix02-layout ring is reported as `fix02_layout`
and not decoded. The SRAM window (0x0010dc00..0x0010e0ff), slots, stamp and
24-entry ring size are unchanged.

**Reset cause.** The watchdog probe reads MT6582 RGU `WDT_STATUS` (+0x0c)
before its first `WDT_MODE` write. `/sys/firmware/y2_pm/reset_status` decodes
it (`watchdog_timeout`, `software_reset`, `watchdog_irq`, `debug_reset`,
`spm_watchdog`). `boot.json`, the previous-boot evidence and the status
snapshot record that cause instead of `not_observed`. A zero value is reported
as `rgu_status_none_reported`, never as proof of a power-on reset; whether the
loader preserves the register is a physical question.

**Not changed.** One hypothesis: the console flush after resume may stall if
UART or fbcon state was lost in SPM sleep. It is not established. With
`loglevel=3` the suspend backlog is small, which weakens it. Per the handoff,
the next RTC attempt names the stalled call, and only that call is corrected.

## 2. SLIDLE: the bus-DCM baseline

**Root cause.** `TOPCKGEN+4` is `DCM_CFG` (AXI bus DCM). The MT6582 BSP never
initializes it (`DCM_ENABLE_DCM_CFG` is undefined, "use default value"), and
`bus_dcm_disable` clears only bit 7 after `bus_dcm_enable` writes 0x8f. The
stock idle baseline is therefore 0x00 before the first slow or deep idle, and
0x0f afterwards. The Y2 predicate demanded exactly 0x0f. The board reads 0x00,
so with radios off and a zero clock mask every attempt failed
`slow_reject_bus` (0 → 20809). This is the same class of mismatch as Fix01's
PWRAP 0x1ff/0x7f.

**Correction.** `y2_bus_dcm_baseline()` accepts {0x00, 0x0f}. Anything else,
including DCM already enabled by another owner, is still refused.
`y2_ccf_slow_idle`, `y2_ccf_deep_idle_begin` and the read-only
`dormant_preflight` all use it. The verified 0x8f write and the exact restore
of the inherited value are unchanged. Clock blockers (APDMA/BTIF with radios
on) remain legitimate refusals.

## 3. Loaded USB upload: a false storm

**Root cause.** The storm guard counted every interrupt per jiffy (HZ=100) and
stopped at 512. With Inventra mode-0 RX DMA, a 512-byte packet costs one
endpoint interrupt and one DMA interrupt, so the guard caps throughput at
about 12 MB/s. In both Fix02 faults the ISR, DMA-interrupt and DMA-programming
deltas match that per-packet pattern with no excess. Boot 1: 1155 interrupts
for 611 programs, against a bound of 1222. A stuck source would have added
≥513 extra interrupts. The two snapshots show different, ordinary mid-transfer
phases (RX pending, DMA channel 5 pending). Fix02 had also recorded a
legitimate peak of 426 per jiffy. The handoff's re-arm hypothesis is not
supported, and the Inventra/MT6582 RX and DMA paths stay unchanged.

**Correction.** `y2_usb_irq_storm()` counts only interrupts that occur without
new accepted DMA programming (counted in the existing `channel_program`
wrapper). It also keeps a hard ceiling of 4096 per jiffy, above the HS bulk
maximum of about 2080. Both remain terminal with the existing snapshot and
teardown. Status adds `irq_max_jiffy`, `irq_jiffy_limit` and `irq_progress`.
PIO (`y2.usb_dma=off`) is guarded as before, since it has no DMA progress.

## 4. Policy defects

| Defect | Correction |
| --- | --- |
| A wake's start-up/render burst on the single parked CPU crossed the 1-s saturation threshold about 0.6 s before the display restore, so the hold doubled (Fix02: `burst_ms=780` already before the wake) | A display, workload or input restore within 2 s of a pressure restore undoes that one escalation (`wake_reclassified`). The reset attribution is kept as observed. Sustained load without a wake still escalates |
| `media.inventory()` keyed SD presence on kernfs inode/ctime; `drop_caches` remounted `/media/sd` twice | The key is now dev_t, the disk sequence number and CID. Reclaim no longer looks like a change, and a re-enumerated identical card still does |
| `admission_error=1` meant success (the positive return of `freq_qos_update_request`) | Successful admission reports 0 |

## Harness

`tools/development/qualify-cpu-fix03.py` corrects the six Fix02 harness
defects: Back (158) drives QoS input; parking and radios-off SLIDLE are
separate verdicts; the warm reboot falls back to Wi-Fi; per-process percent is
of one core; charger refusal is read from `failed_stage=DPM_PREPARED
error=-16`; and a launch step runs once on one probed host, with the
`rtc-alarm` output captured to a receipt. It adds the display-wake hold check,
a detached radios-off SLIDLE job, five RTC cycles, and the naming of the
stalled resume call from the timed ring.

## Tests added

`tests/test_cpu_fix03.py` exercises the real functions on host models. It
covers the bus baseline for slow and deep idle, including exact restore,
refusal of 0x8f and the shared preflight predicate. For USB it replays the
Fix02 counts and checks a stuck source, the hard ceiling and the driver
wiring. It covers wake reclassification and its boundaries, SD identity
across kernfs reclaim and re-enumeration, the order of every resume-window
mark, the timed ring decode with stage entries, backstop pings on callbacks,
RGU decode, the probe read order and the `boot.json` cause, the DVFS label,
and the harness helpers and plan. Fix02/Final fixtures were updated to the new
ring contract and guard state.

A first build from `6dfbfe7` failed the container regression suite. One older
fixture (`test_hardware_ceiling` DMA observer) did not define the new progress
counter. The fixture was corrected in `76a5d41` (test-only), and the candidate
was rebuilt, repackaged and revalidated from that commit. The superseded
outputs are kept privately with a `superseded-…-6dfbfe7` prefix. A later
documentation commit seals this receipt and changes no built kernel or
userspace (recorded in the candidate's `sources/campaign-docs-commit.txt`).
The Git identity, its configuration and the authenticated account are
unchanged. There is no model attribution and no push.
