# Y2 C3 UART candidate physical record

<!-- knowledge-base-scope: exact-image-validation-receipt; baseline02-sync 2026-10-03 -->

## Baseline02 scope and current evidence

[Baseline02](Y2-BASELINE-02.md) is now the newest sealed candidate with automatic qualified CPU0 C3
startup. New-image/cold-boot hardware remains PHYSICAL_NOT_RUN. The
[UART01 physical receipt](Y2-CPU-C3-UART-PHYSICAL.md) proves bounded C1/C2/C3 on its exact installed pair.
Default-off, UART blocker, pending-flash and harness preparation statements
below retain their recorded image/session scope. They do not describe the new
Baseline02 startup policy or reopen the solved UART01 architecture. This report's
original exact-image evidence is preserved; full system suspend and battery
measurements remain separate.


## UART01 physical qualification — 2026-10-03

**PASS. C1 WORKING; C2 WORKING; C3 WORKING_AND_REPEATEDLY_OBSERVED.**
This supersedes all prior NOT_RUN/never-entered/software-awaiting-flash
statements for this installed pair. No new build or owner flash is needed.
C3 is intentionally enabled through normal runtime policy for this boot;
fresh image boots remain default disabled/budget0. No persistent default-on
policy or full-system suspend qualification was performed.

No flash, push, protected-partition/data wipe, arbitrary userspace MMIO or
forced UART gate was performed. Six preexisting owner documentation edits are
preserved separately.

### Preserved C1/C2, topology and performance

All four enabled WFI states advance;400 requested1ms sleeps return on their
bound cores. These elapsed sleeps include scheduling and are not direct
silicon exit-latency measurements.

| CPU | Entry delta | Residency delta, us | Rejections | Median / maximum requested1ms sleep, ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 1573 | 11919284 | 0 | 1.085065 / 1.174603 |
| 1 | 521 | 12104878 | 0 | 1.085143 / 2.729740 |
| 2 | 1343 | 12348263 | 0 | 1.084604 / 1.110065 |
| 3 | 271 | 12302521 | 0 | 1.084604 / 1.130142 |

C1 MONOTONIC/RAW drift−121412ns over12.067737s. Eighteen normal hotplug
transitions check CPU3→2→1 off and1→2→3 on, including both exact physical SPM
power copies. Natural coordinator parking reaches CPU0/owned mask0xe; no
manual secondary power writes or forced parking are used for C3. Each C3
admission verifies owned topology, both copies showing secondary bits0 and
all static prerequisites. Screen and real playback demand restore all cores.

C2 adds **6971 entries and50,654,676us in60.054880715s: 84.35% residency**.
Slow-clock restore failures0, idle failures0. Legitimate MSDC/APDMA/radio/I2C
and other guards remain. Before/after clock/bus/MMC/timer/CPU/IRQ snapshots
are retained. No C1/C2 redesign or blocker masking was needed.

All five OPPs pass before and after C3 with voltage readback:
598/747.5/1040MHz at1.15V,1196MHz at1.20V,1300MHz at1.25V. Schedutil,
thermal authority, PWRAP, boost/QoS and original active ceiling are preserved.

### UART contract physically proved

All exposed static C3 prerequisites pass when CPU0 alone, CPUs1–3 physically
off, screen/radios off, USB detached, no workload, <=747.5MHz, real owned
clocks/media idle, CIRQ/GPT4/context/480-word PCM available and budget/backstop
armed. UART1 hardware clock remains present (PERI bit17); its conditional PIO
sleep adoption is ready. UART0 console sleep enable is1, DMA0. UART1 normal
bank LCR/IER/DMA are0; temporary UART_SLEEP_EN changes0→1→0 with exact checked
restore. Hardware UART1 PERI gate remains0 before and after, with zero UART
restore failures. No FIFO/data/baud/gate/reset/pinmux write is used.

Actual SPM request sets POWER_ON_VAL1 **0x15820→0x15821**, hardware R13 changes
**0x8040000→0x8140000** on the first entry (bit20 ACK); wake cleanup restores
**0x15820**. All3647 final UART attempts receive ACK, successes3647,
timeouts0, request restore failures0, live request/ACK0 after wake.
This is the exact stock global pair, not a UART1-specific ACK. The source-backed
conditional owner contract, rather than permanently dropping bit17, resolves
the prior admission error. The conditional follow-up for a failed UART
handshake is not needed: no physical UART handshake failed.

### First real entry and twenty further guarded cycles

The first25ms observation window produces exactly one CPU context entry,
reset resume and success: **8,065us driver /9,363us cpuidle residency**.
GPT wake reason0x10, PCM debug0, same boot, taint0. SRAM contains
UART_REQUEST→UART_ACK→DORMANT_CONTEXT→DORMANT_FINISH→DORMANT_RETURN→restores→
DORMANT_COMPLETE with reset-vector assembly stamp **0x59325253**.
CPU resume is genuine: the MMU-off reset vector records that stamp and
branches into normal Linux `cpu_resume_arm`; it is not an unchanged-WFI counter.

Twenty additional independent budget1/RGU10s cycles complete successfully,
with25/50/100/200ms observation windows. EXACTLY one actual entry, resume,
success and UART request/ACK per cycle; positive residency and every checked
restore. Guarded driver residency totals211,010us; cpuidle totals238,313us.
All21 retained traces have the reset stamp, checked return and restore stages.
No failed CPU context entry, missed timer, watchdog reset or corruption occurs.

GPT4 finisher deadlines range **3,471,384..18,392,615ns**, all safely above2ms.
Compare-minus-count conversion exactly matches13MHz within integer rounding;
IRQ bit3 armed, source clock0, future compare and no pending handoff IRQ.
Architectural timer state restores21/21 then3647/3647 overall, failures0,
all four CNTFRQ13000000/per-core errors0. GPT6 free-run/highres/NO_HZ and sole
GPT4 broadcast remain ready. Twenty requested1ms wake windows add no C3 entry;
this observes near-deadline fallback, not proof that a specific guard executed
instead of the governor choosing a shallower state. Unit tests cover the exact
2ms/26000-tick rules.

CIRQ64–218 clones and flushes3647/3647, clone/restore failures0, inactive on
return. Pending banks are0 in bounded snapshots; do not infer an experimentally
injected edge-replay result from zero pending bits. Linux cpu_pm/cluster_pm,
GIC/VFP and cpu_suspend/cpu_resume own generic context; retained cache/BIU
checks and functional same-boot storage/render/playback/hotplug pass. No custom
duplicate MMU/VFP/GIC restore or later-SoC CIRQ layout is introduced. Runtime
PCM remains exact MT6582 d53dd75c DPIDLE **480 words / IM length479**; normal
restore returns to28 words. Infrastructure/DDRPHY/L2 stay retained.

### Meaningful normal-policy idle

After21 guarded successes, budget-1 enables ordinary scheduler-selected C3
for60.088343522s. It adds **3624 successful DORMANT entries and39,204,662us:
65.25% cpuidle residency**. Another two entries occur after the sampled window
before USB restoration. Final **3647 entries=resumes=successes=UART requests=
ACKs=CIRQ clones/flushes=timer context saves/restores**, driver residency
39,100,882us. UART/PCM/clock/timer/CIRQ/context failures0 and same boot.

| Window | Seconds | CPU utilization | Online CPUs | CPU0 C1, s | C2, s | C3, s | IRQ/s | Context switches/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen on idle | 20.065239 | 3.63% | 0–3 | see raw metrics | 0 | 0 | 447.69 | 528.48 |
| Screen off before parking | 20.069114 | 3.63% | 0–3 | see raw metrics | 0 | 0 | 361.55 | 412.57 |
| Parked C2 enabled | 60.054881 | 8.35% | 0 | see raw metrics | 50.654676 | 0 | 185.05 | 337.86 |

C3 window ends at37.526/37.500°C,598MHz before/747.5MHz after; MONOTONIC/RAW
drift−410481ns. Bounded-window drift magnitude≤2727ns. These are separate
physical windows, not a controlled electrical comparison: C3 has useful
residency and lower sampled IRQ rate but slightly higher CPU utilization.
No battery-duration or electrical power improvement is claimed.

### Storage and wake regressions

Both eMMC `/data` and inserted SD `/media/sd` pass eight fsynced/readback
checksum rounds each after C2 and after C3. Controllers runtime-gate with
request/DMA/FIFO/controller/IRQ ownership checks; saved state mismatch0,
errors0 and all ext4 error counters0. No live root/data reset or raw media write.
SD-absent C3 testing is not claimed; no physical removal was requested.
Screen wake restores all four cores. Indexed silent playback exercises actual
FFmpeg/ALSA and PlaybackNormal QoS, with clean decoding and unchanged error/
xrun counters. All five OPPs pass again. USB bidirectional1MiB integrity passes
three rounds with an independent pinned Wi-Fi observer; Wi-Fi runtime restores
and same-boot observation succeeds. Final dmesg has no new filesystem/MMC/IRQ/
BUG/Oops error. Cleanup errors0; temporary owned key-only observer removed.

### Observer defects and preserved raw evidence

The original packaged harness stopped before UART entry because it fsynced
its durable arm receipt after checking clocks: legitimate MSDC0 bit12 then
blocked C3. Correct the harness to save FIRST, then check real MMC gates and
all prerequisites over a read-only stable window, with C3 disabled. Initial
admission also waits rather than sampling a transient storage clock once.
No MMC guard or runtime-PM owner is weakened.

SPM `dormant_attempts` counts admission calls BEFORE budget/static guards.
The first real success included two consumed-budget refusals, and cycle17
included two earlier safe refusals before the last successful return. The
original checker wrongly required exactly one admission, then wrongly required
the last call to be budget-refused. Correct interpretation accounts every extra
admission as an abort while requiring exactly one ACTUAL context entry/return/
success/ACK and all original restore guards plus checked sleep flag and SRAM
reset stamp. Original FAIL receipts remain untouched; independent rechecks
prove their genuine successful entries. Closing generic admission attempts
18455/aborts14808 reflect dynamic topology/clock/budget guards, not failed
hardware entries. Counts can grow while owner transports/cores are restored.

No physical failure was retried. C3 was disabled/budget0 after each observer
stop. One first success plus17 individually rechecked cycles were resumed
through a hash-checked same-boot contiguous receipt; only the remaining3 were
run. Normal policy was enabled only after the21 checks. New boots/source or
missing/failed UART/context/restore evidence reject continuation before mutation.
The sealed packaged harness remains historical; use current
`tools/development/qualify-cpu-idle-completion.py` and neighboring device helper
for subsequent qualification. c8ae170 contains these localized fixes;33 fresh
harness/CPU/UART tests pass. Existing375/source109/native host/Reborn238/ARM/
QEMU/config/DT/modules/ABI/ELF/package validation remains valid because the
installed kernel/production binaries are unchanged.

Raw evidence: `out/cpu-c3-uart-physical/20261003T183259Z-uart01/`.
`final-verdict.json` joins all physical assertions; `guarded-21-cycles.json`
retains every original row and corrected independent verdict; original
`qualification/`, `corrected-c3/`, `repeat-c3/`, `repeat-c3-settled/` and final
`final-c3/` receipts retain command/UTC/source/boot/exit/stdout/stderr and
harness SHA256. `verified-18-entry-receipt.json` is explicitly derived and
lists original receipt SHA256; final SSH status/health/dmesg/timers/IRQs are
under `closing/` and `final-snapshot.json`.

### Research, changed files and owner action

Exact MT6582/Y2 research and pinned source/register/PCM origins are in
[Y2-CPU-C3-UART.md](Y2-CPU-C3-UART.md). This installed test required only
`tools/development/cpu_idle_completion_device.py`,
`tools/development/qualify-cpu-idle-completion.py` and
`tests/test_cpu_idle_harness.py` fixes plus current validation/release/roadmap
receipts. No Reborn or kernel implementation change after install.

**Next owner action: none for this installed hardware qualification.** Use the
player normally. C3 remains runtime-enabled/budget-1 on this boot; original
screen/radio/schedutil598–1300MHz/coordinator settings are restored and RGU
is disarmed. Normal guards still exclude active USB/radios/workloads/high OPP
or multi-core topology. Fresh boots remain default-off/budget0: persistent
boot policy is a separate release decision. Full-system suspend, additional
wake-source coverage, longer endurance and electrical battery measurement
remain distinct work; the remaining UART1 C3 blocker is closed.

The following software handoff is **historical**, prior to this owner install.

## UART01 sealed software handoff — 2026-10-03

**C3 SOFTWARE_READY_NEEDS_NEW_FLASH. New candidate physical NOT_RUN.**
Owner flash is the remaining boundary. C3 has never been entered on the
connected candidate02; neither hardware failure nor hardware impossibility
is established. C1/C2 physical working results are preserved.

Candidate: `out/y2linux-cpu-c3-uart-candidate/`.

implement the contract and required kernel errno include; subsequent docs are
receipts, not a different installed/build source.

Fresh kernel/Buildroot/Reborn ARM and config/DT/modules/ABI checks pass.
Production suite375 cases: five minimal-host dependency skips are covered by
native filesystem/GIO/ALSA tests and ARM compilation/query. Extended source
contracts109, native packaging/filesystem/GIO27, ALSA evidence3 and Reborn238
cases pass; formatting/Clippy, Cortex-A7 QEMU, installed ARM helpers and ELF
checks pass. Preserving package, source seal (445 source/license files) and
sealed-image validation pass. Collector limitations remain recorded; this is
an owner-local package, not public distribution approval.

Only BOOTIMG/ANDROID payloads and accepted candidate02 fallback BOOTIMG/ROOT
are packaged; no Y2DATA, preloader/LK/NVRAM/PROTECT/calibration/table payload.

Owner action: use `MT6582_preserve_data_scatter.txt`, Download Only, selecting
BOOTIMG.img and ANDROID/Y2ROOT.img. Preserve existing Y2DATA. Boot normally,
then confirm installation; the prepared SSH harness will verify identity and
preserved regressions, attempt one25ms RGU/SRAM/budget1 timer wake, and allow20
further cycles only after real UART ACK and all same-boot restore checks pass.
The packaged `CPU-C3-UART-OWNER-HANDOFF.md` gives the exact invocation.
C3 stays default disabled/budget0 until the guarded physical test. No flash or
push was performed; six preexisting owner doc edits remain unstaged.

Final read-only SSH receipt:
`out/cpu-c3-uart-physical/20261003T164546Z/read-only-close.json`.
Installed identity remains Linuxdb0234e/Rebornb71b4688, kernelidle-02/rootv1.19,
boot `f155196b-64d4-45a4-88b3-27755a1a8926`, C3 disabled/budget0/entries0,
expected prior probe taint4096. It contains no new UART handshake or deep wake.

2026-10-03: new C3 UART candidate **NOT_RUN**; C3
**SOFTWARE_READY_NEEDS_NEW_FLASH**. No hardware ACK or dormant entry is claimed.

Installed candidate02 remains physically C1/C2 WORKING. C3 has never been
entered. Its settled blocker is hardware UART1 PERI bit17 at0x11003000,
not the Linux UART0 console. Existing physical evidence remains authoritative
in [Y2-CPU-IDLE-COMPLETION-PHYSICAL.md](Y2-CPU-IDLE-COMPLETION-PHYSICAL.md).
Fresh targeted read-only admission is under
`out/cpu-c3-uart-physical/20261003T164546Z/`: Linuxdb0234e/Rebornb71b4688,
kernelcpu-idle-02/rootv1.19, boot
`f155196b-64d4-45a4-88b3-27755a1a8926`, C3 disabled/budget0, prior probe
taint4096. No runtime controls, register writes or C3 attempts were made.

[The source contract and implementation](Y2-CPU-C3-UART.md) explain why an
eligible active UART clock can defer to the stock global request/ACK rather
than being forced off. The next result must capture the real ACK and return,
not merely an improved preflight. Owner flashing is required to install those
changes. A fresh normal boot removes the earlier probe taint; the harness
requires taint0 and exact package identity before guarded tests.

Run the packaged host harness after owner confirmation. It checks preserved
regressions, arms one bounded25ms timer wake with budget1/RGU/retained stages,
then20 further checked cycles only after success. Require unchanged boot,
new attempts/entries/resumes/successes and UART ACK, positive residency and
all timer/CIRQ/context/clock/media restores. Missing ACK must record UART_BUSY,
request cleanup and no dormant entry. Any failed trial disables C3 and stops
repetition. Store new raw SSH evidence under `out/cpu-c3-uart-physical/`.

Do not overwrite the candidate02 counters or promote C3 physical/release status
until those observations exist. Full-system suspend and electrical battery
measurement are outside this narrow pass.
