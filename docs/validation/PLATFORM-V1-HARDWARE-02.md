IMAGE_VALIDATED_PHYSICAL_PENDING, 2026-09-26. The installed unit still runs
Physical 01. This is a single preserving BOOTIMG + root update, not a frozen
hardware platform or a qualified performance ceiling.

Local package: `out/y2linux-hardware-02-candidate/`.
Read its `install.md`, `qualification.md`, `manifest.json` and
`validation/summary.json`. Exact fallback is the currently installed Physical
01 pair; no Y2DATA payload, formatting, repartitioning or protected-region write.

## Included scope

- eMMC/SD retain 8/4-bit wiring and 3.3 V, adding source-backed SDR high-speed
  negotiation with a 25 MHz initial cap and bounded 13/25/50 MHz qualification
  controls. Failed clock changes restore the previous state; unrecoverable
  clock restoration rejects requests before command/DMA. Boot parameter
  `y2.mmc_safe=1` retains the crystal/legacy path. No DDR/UHS/HS200 mode.
- MUSB uses upstream Inventra DMA, 32-bit addressing, exact stock interrupt
  ownership, DMA bus-fault teardown and overflow observations. Boot parameter
  `y2.usb_dma=off` and allocation failure retain PIO. No host VBUS activation.
- GPT6 is initialized through its existing owner and checked against GPT2
  before registering the physical architectural timer on PPI29. This provides
  the implementation for local high-resolution/NO_HZ timers. Initialization
  failure or `y2.local_timer=off` retains GPT/dummy behavior. Integrated physical
  continuity, interrupt delivery and hotplug remain acceptance gates.
- Reborn includes the physically tested native PCM device-name contract repair.
  The suspend helper now reports radio restoration failure instead of rc=0.
  USB overflow snapshots improve diagnosis; the suspend fault is not fixed.

## Validation and limits

170 locked production tests pass; three additional tests are explicitly skipped
for absent native dependencies and covered by passing packaging-host runs
(18 filesystem/preservation tests and nine GIO/ALSA tests). Reborn's workspace
passes 180 tests. Eight Reborn ARM/QEMU checks, target ABI/shell checks, 20 target
Python module imports, SQLite WAL/checkpoint, ALSA null queries, a 1k target
library scan, and three actual ARM SFTP protocol/failure cases pass.

Kernel/config/DT, zero-fuzz overlay identities, D08/LK read extent, BOOTIMG,
rescue/module release, regulatory database equality, root contents/clean ext4,
protected-storage policies, preserving scatter and exact fallback validate.
Inventory covers 102 packages. Source bundles, source pins, license collection
results and failed-attempt explanations accompany the package. Byte-identical
userspace rebuilds and firmware redistribution permission are not established.

The real unit recovered after the suspend incident with a fresh boot, exact
Physical 01 identity, taint 0 and zero ext4 error counters. Its persistent log
proves CPU3/2/1 restart but exposes USB overflow and radio restore timeout;
core/SPM entry and deep wake remain open. Checked DNS passes; a transient
supplicant observer timeout remains. RTC standard UTC write/read/ticking pass,
while retention/alarm wake remain pending.

## First physical acceptance

After the owner flashes once, verify the exact new source pair and boot ID,
root/data recovery, pinned USB SSH, taint, MMC errors/IOS and conservative cap,
checked DNS/TCP, menu, wired/BT audio and thermal/memory telemetry. Inspect actual
DMA counters and per-CPU clockevents before interpreting performance.

Then measure 25 MHz storage repeatedly with readback/fsync/metadata/SQLite,
qualify the SD's negotiated mode, and only raise the host cap to an evidenced
50 MHz after clean results. Repeat RAM/storage-separated USB tests, timer
continuity/NO_HZ and core cycles with safe fallbacks. Record failures rather
than promoting modes merely because they boot. Further suspend uses one detached,
persistently recorded stage and verified subsystem/host recovery before the
next stage. No unattended multi-stage suspend loop.
