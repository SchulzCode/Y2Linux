# Platform v1 completion ledger

Started 2026-09-23. **Y2Linux Platform v1 Candidate is declared as a software
candidate**, following the final standing boundary audit and current-source
validation. PHYSICALLY_QUALIFIED and ENDURANCE_QUALIFIED remain false for this
candidate. No Y2 was contacted or flashed; no protected partition, calibration,
NVRAM, loader, memory reservation or electrical limit was changed.

| Repository | Starting HEAD | Entry worktree |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Y2Linux | `5f6b4468fb43605ca1da679420823afa72cea73f` | Modified `docs/planning/roadmap-gap-audit.md`; untracked `docs/CURRENT_PLATFORM_STATE.md`, `docs/planning/platform-review-evidence-2026-09-23.md`. Supplied review content preserved. |
| Y2Reborn | `d9ba0549e6b34eff029bd13f7c33a491fee09e66` | Untracked `docs/architecture/bluetooth-codecs.md`, `docs/audit/`, `docs/review/`; preserved. |

`git status`, `git rev-parse HEAD`, and the latest 30 commits were inspected in
both repositories before edits. Existing configured identities are unchanged.
No reset, clean, forced checkout, history rewrite, push or physical flashing.

The [roadmap](../planning/platform-v1-roadmap.md) orders implementation. The
[September 23 evidence ledger](../planning/platform-review-evidence-2026-09-23.md)
is the starting assessment. Reborn's later `LUNA-CORRECTNESS-CLOSURE-01.md`
supersedes repaired R1–R10 findings; R9B's plug-hidden transport remains limited.

Every capability will retain separate implementation, host, ARM, image, physical
and endurance evidence. DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED / ARM_VALIDATED /
IMAGE_VALIDATED are workflow labels; PHYSICAL_GATE / BLOCKED_BY_EVIDENCE /
DEFERRED retain their literal limits. No previous image's physical qualification
is transferred to the new candidate.

## Final candidate and validation

The built source pair is Y2Linux `d04b95aaff713edf943042d97a4c6134ca19fc24`
and Reborn `6c8aa128550ec80addd08ef3145e9d5a846ddf2e`. Later repository HEADs
contain only the closing documentation; the candidate's
`metadata/final-heads.json` records those separately from compiled source.
The [60-capability report](PLATFORM-V1-CAPABILITY-REPORT.md) and
[machine ledger](platform-v1-capabilities.json) record starting state,
implementation, tests, commits, ARM/image results, physical gates and remaining
risk. Unsupported capabilities do not inherit validation from their gate-reporting
tools. The [freeze audit](../planning/roadmap-gap-audit.md#platform-v1-software-freeze-boundary--2026-09-23-utc)
reconciles every coverage area with retained real hardware evidence.

Candidate: `out/y2linux-platform-v1-candidate/`. Build/validation workspace:
`out/y2linux-platform-v1-build/`. Release `1.0.0-candidate.1`, rootfs
`2025.02.18-platform-v1.1`, build ID `Y2LINUX-PLATFORM-V1-CANDIDATE-01`,
kernel `6.18.0-y2linux-platform-v1-candidate-01`, platform API/layout/data schema 1.

| Final check | Result and actual scope |
| --- | --- |
| Kernel/config/modules/ABI, rescue/DT/BOOTIMG | PASS current source, existing size/layout/protected-region contracts |
| Buildroot ARM + Reborn ARM | PASS current paired source; fresh final workspace, resumed after concrete packaging metadata fixes |
| Host platform/maintenance/update/qualification | 64 passed, no skips; real fault/control contracts |
| Locked platform suite | 56 cases: 54 passed, two native GIO/ALSA development-dependency skips covered by the host suite and installed ARM checks |
| Production tooling/kernel contracts | 68 passed |
| Power/radio/USB/GPU/suspend subsystem contracts | 39 passed |
| Reborn host workspace | 155 passed; formatting and strict all-target clippy passed |
| QEMU Cortex-A7 userspace | 8 passed; no physical hardware emulation claim |
| ARM native updater faults | 7 passed on private regular files; signature/device/schema, corruption, reserve, interrupted write, readback, missing health, revocation and rescue containment |
| Installed ARM SFTP | 3 protocol checks: write/close/readback, reserve refusal, interrupted session |
| Installed ARM platform/application tools | 20 Python modules import, unavailable fixture health, SQLite WAL/checkpoint, OpenSSL, readonly ALSA null constraints, actual defaults and 1k database/scanner/UI benchmark pass |
| Installed production ARM updater | Full signed 512 MiB root payload accepted; corrupted signature rejected before payload; no queue/block-device mutation |
| FFmpeg/ELF/dependencies/package | PASS exact versions, ARM/hard-float, ext4/tar agreement, no fixture writer, candidate qualified flags false, USB-only SSH and preserve-data package |
| Source and license inventory | 102 selected nonvirtual packages, 87 remote inputs with strong hashes; Buildroot legal-info passes with documented local/external-package collection warnings |

These suites overlap; counts are not added into a marketing total. QEMU null
ALSA constraints do not validate Y2's wider formats. Synthetic ARM/host library
results do not establish target timing budgets. The actual installed updater is
separately tested from the explicitly test-compiled file fault harness.

Final packaging fixed an unanchored BlueZ `start()` guard that also matched
`restart()`, and a validator that mistook the existing Dropbear `ssh` alias for
an extra OpenSSH client. Both have targeted regression cases. FFmpeg's license
hash now matches the pinned 9.0.2 archive. The supplicant top-level license pin
was reverified and preserved after distinguishing it from the different nested
README. The initial preflight and intermediate receipts remain labelled by their
old source pairs; none substitutes for the final receipts. Host UID/ALSA config
namespace and verifier-output harness mismatches were corrected without changing
product behavior. No failed intermediate run is presented as a pass.

The installed tree contains 88,666,583 unique regular-file bytes. The inventory's
439,025,495 pathname-summed bytes include 32 repeated hard-link names, chiefly
Mesa aliases; they are not that much unique storage. The 512 MiB root image uses
28,676 × 4096-byte ext4 blocks (about 112 MiB), including filesystem metadata.
No package was removed from an ELF-reference guess. Buildroot legal-info omits
some local/external license collections; Git bundles retain local licensed
sources, and pinned Buildroot/Bootlin inputs remain documented. This is not a
claim of exhaustive legal review, public firmware redistribution permission,
byte-identical rebuilding or absence of all security defects.

## Exact artifacts and owner handoff

The package contains current BOOTIMG/Y2ROOT, one preserve-data scatter, verified
previous BOOTIMG/Y2ROOT fallback, manifest and hashes, signed development root OTA,
source bundles, build/package/license inventories, validation receipts, benchmark
and qualification tools, precision fixtures and owner sessions. **No replacement
Y2DATA image** is supplied. The fallback is the older correctness-closure software
package, not a physically qualified fallback; it predates the current Reborn
integration. Rescue's verified backup of the actually installed previous root is
separate from those manual fallback files.

| File | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `BOOTIMG.img` | 6756352 | `f7b4a950a0504a411ad72db0aac9398f04dc1ccabd6a6a0a3a7fdab198ca2622` |
| `Y2ROOT.img` | 536870912 | `970330d24f6a0bddb0cb685d37232b298566c5cd7025a45990566f03c3f66fa3` |
| `updates/development-v1/rootfs.ext4.gz` | 36852721 | `28a3f46883de71d3687920b5583ea54673a3470b9e02163bb49c834aa5c8ce23` |

`SHA256SUMS` covers the complete assembled package; `manifest.json` binds the
manual image pair and `updates/development-v1/manifest.json` is separately signed
with Ed25519. Key ID `platform-v1-development-20260923` is development trust,
sequence 1, with explicit signed development downgrade and rollback permission.
The private key remains outside repositories/artifacts/device in the owner's
private signing directory; only its public registry is packaged. A release-key
transition or revocation in old rescue requires separately controlled trusted
BOOTIMG maintenance. Root-only OTA requires this exact kernel and is not a
first-install substitute. Automatic BOOTIMG updates remain excluded because a
torn single-slot write can destroy rescue availability.

Owner next actions are precisely grouped in
[PLATFORM-V1-OWNER-QUALIFICATION.md](PLATFORM-V1-OWNER-QUALIFICATION.md): preserve
state/recovery and verify hashes, review the paired manual preserve-data install,
then Session A core/recovery/UI/input/S16/USB; B storage/SD/SQLite/library/resources;
C Wi-Fi IP/route/DNS/throughput/reconnect; D manual SBC/AVRCP/coexistence. E power
and G OTA are separately controlled after their prerequisites. F wider audio
remains blocked by missing AFE packing/clock evidence. Complete short sessions
before the corresponding 8-hour/cycle workloads. No threshold, watchdog, deep
suspend, unsupported rate or VBUS path is enabled automatically.

After owner acceptance of the advertised core, return feature development to
Y2Reborn and maintain the platform contract. All current-candidate hardware and
endurance rows remain PHYSICAL_GATE until exact owner evidence promotes them.
The read-only tracker inventory remains #16/#27/#28/#29/#31/#32/#33/#34 open and
prior #30 closed; no remote issue, branch, account or Git identity was changed.

## Historical implementation checkpoints

The remaining entries preserve the order in which work was implemented and
validated. Their contemporary pending notes are superseded by the final pair
and evidence table above where the code was subsequently completed; they do not
reopen fixed issues or grant higher evidence to an unimplemented hardware path.

## Entry audit

Read retained Storage06, GPU-01, CONNECTIVITY-10 and USB reconnect receipts.
Internal boot and root/data identity, narrow wired audio and rendering have
physical evidence. Same-boot deep resume failed; current USB PM ownership already
exists. Association/DHCP/DNS, peer/SBC audio and current charging envelope remain
unqualified. Read-only GitHub inventory confirms #16/#27/#28/#29/#31/#32/#33/#34
open, #30 closed; no tracker change is warranted or made. All implementation is
owner-authorized by the completion request; no planning epic supplies hardware
authorization.

## Implementation and validation

### Low-power/audio boundaries and early evidence

DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED: readonly native ALSA combination query, exact
24-bit precision/channel fixtures, once-per-boot bounded private previous-log
retention and default refusal of unqualified deep suspend. Sixteen targeted
evidence/suspend/observation tests pass. No driver masks, voltage, trip point,
reserved RAM or SPM code changed. The pinned vendor review and exact remaining
proof are in `knowledge/platform-v1-hardware-gates.md`. ARM/image coverage for
these new tools follows in the final fresh build.

The USB/update pair `1c2451e` / `f4b83b7` completed fresh kernel, Buildroot ARM,
Reborn ARM, FFmpeg/ELF/artifact checks, 42 platform cases (one native host
dependency case covered separately), 67 production and 38 subsystem tests,
plus eight QEMU userspace checks. Seven actual ARM updater fault tests passed
under Cortex-A7 QEMU. The installed ARM SFTP subsystem passed real protocol
write/readback, reserve refusal and interrupted-session checks. Host UID and
locked-host compiler harness mismatches were resolved without product changes.
Receipts: `out/platform-v1-update-build`. These are not physical update/USB proof,
and do not cover newer maintenance or phase-7 source.

### Telemetry, health, capability and boot record foundation

DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED for the implemented observation contracts.
`tools/platform/y2_platform` provides versioned JSON, CPU/residency/VM/PSS,
die thermal/power, mount identity/space, Wi-Fi readiness, audio/USB/update state,
capabilities, bounded queries and boot history. Rescue's stale charging statement
is corrected without adding a Python dependency to rescue. Initramfs stages are
instrumented, without removing any identity, fsck or recovery gate.

`python3 -m unittest tests.test_platform_contract -v`: 10 pass, exercising source
disappearance/reinsertion, counter reset, missing measurements, DHCP timeout,
stale DNS epochs, corrupt records, space reserves, previous boot retention,
symlink refusal and subprocess deadlines/output bounds. Full health currently
adds query-only checks; scratch/SQLite integration follows in phase 2.

ARM_BUILT and IMAGE_VALIDATED are pending a fresh build. No physical/endurance
claims. Python target footprint/collection cost need measurement. D-Bus transport
observation, richer service fault counters, time readiness and update readiness
remain implementation work in their dependent streams. Persistent early crash
cause and AP watchdog recovery remain PHYSICAL_GATE / BLOCKED_BY_EVIDENCE;
unclean shutdown is never labelled panic or watchdog without evidence.

The first fresh phase-1 build completed the kernel and ARM ABI selftest, then
exposed an unexercised BlueZ 5.87 headers-only recipe: Python selects it, but the
old recipe installed `lib/*.h` after upstream moved headers to `lib/bluetooth`.
The pinned modernization adapter now updates that path. This failed build is
retained at `out/platform-v1-observation-build/buildroot-build.log`; it is not an
ARM userspace pass. Validation resumes after the focused recipe correction.

### Space, SD lifecycle and storage benchmark tools

DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED: platform mount claims, failed unmount handling,
read-only unmounted checks, low/critical admission reserves, bounded disposable
cleanup and descriptor-pinned scratch measurements. Added Linux exFAT and pinned
exfatprogs; no controller/electrical change. `python3 -m unittest
tests.test_platform_storage_tools tests.test_platform_contract -v`: 19 pass,
including actual scratch I/O, generation loss, readback, ENOSPC error propagation,
failed eject, exFAT selection, symlink refusal and cleanup exclusions. Tests use
host files and fake mount command responses, not physical block devices.

ARM/image validation is pending for this stream. Physical card lifecycle,
throughput/latency, flush semantics and endurance remain PHYSICAL_GATE. SQLite,
Reborn scaling and long-run resource collection follow; no database policy was
optimized without measurements. Detailed contract: `architecture/platform-storage-v1.md`.

### Fresh observation build and measurement continuation

The recipe correction completed the phase-1 build at Linux `82da3f9` / Reborn
`d9ba054`. `out/platform-v1-observation-build` retains kernel/ABI, Buildroot ARM,
Reborn/FFmpeg verification, artifact validation, production tests and an eight
check QEMU userspace pass (`hardware_validation: false`). ARM Python 3.12.14
loaded SQLite 3.53.4/OpenSSL 3.5.8 and exercised fixture status under Cortex-A7
QEMU. Installed target is approximately 74 MiB, including 15 MiB Python standard
library. This receipt does not cover subsequent phase-2 source changes or declare
a final installation package/image qualified.

DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED: `y2-platform bench-library` invokes the actual
Reborn database, scanner and UI through an inherited, private scratch directory
FD. It supports 1k/10k/20k tracks, optional generated short WAV scanning and
reserve/inode/deadline checks. Reborn commits `8732287`, `17dd464` implement the
benchmark and remove full Track cloning/per-wheel row allocations; track screens
build only visible rows. SQLite schema/cache/checkpoint policy is unchanged.
Host raw records are in `out/platform-v1-host-measurements`: 20k short-WAV scan
11.7 s, incremental 411 ms; wheel p50 before 2.713 ms / after 0.033 ms (1k:
0.129 / 0.002 ms; 10k: 1.334 / 0.016 ms). Host page cache was uncontrolled;
these are neither cold-device nor Y2 budgets. Reborn library benchmark test,
13 UI + 27 runtime tests and four storage tests passed.

`collect` emits bounded JSONL for CPU/residency/memory/thermal/wakeups/services
and optional Reborn metrics. Memory growth starts after a chosen warmup and uses
boot/PID/start-time identity; its slope is not a leak diagnosis. No workload,
radio, suspend or power transition is triggered by collection. The output limit
is 64 MiB; retain output on the owner host for long physical runs.

22 platform tests pass, including real SQLite WAL and checkpoint ENOSPC at an
injected pwrite boundary and recovery of committed rows after abrupt process
exit. The test-only preload shim targets one new private scratch database and
is never installed in the image. This is syscall fault injection, not electrical
power-loss durability. Prior Reborn operational-error/corruption tests remain
applicable; storage replacement tests protect the replacement card via pinned
FDs. SD device-instance identity additionally rejects reused block minors.

### Shutdown and normal low-battery mechanism

DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED: independent supervised power owner, private
credential-checked request/ack socket, immutable monotonic deadline, bounded
service/journal/sync steps and BusyBox init handoff. Reborn acknowledges only
after audio/session/SQLite shutdown; ordinary commands share the platform path.
Three focused platform tests exercise ignored app, failed sync/init, stale/PID
reuse acknowledgements, daemon restart and synthetic debounce/hysteresis. Reborn
runtime/library/platform suites passed, plus a real database checkpoint/close
acknowledgement test. No final voltage thresholds or charger changes are made.
ARM/image validation is pending. Threshold/reserve and physical power transitions
remain PHYSICAL_GATE; see `architecture/platform-power-v1.md`.

### Wi-Fi, time/entropy and platform lifecycle integration

DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED: epoch-checked DHCP configuration, passive Wi-Fi
failure monitoring, bounded DNS probes and fresh service readiness, standard NTP,
clock/TLS readiness, persistent per-device seedrng and owner network/throughput
helper. Reborn distinguishes authenticated from Online and rejects stale records.
SD lifecycle now runs independently of Reborn, including removed-device claim
validation and five-attempt failed-unmount bounds. Four network/time and two new
SD tests pass; the new Reborn freshness and SD-instance tests pass. This does not
qualify RTC, Wi-Fi connections, SD removal or performance on Y2.

Fresh phase-2 ARM build at Linux `5049761` / Reborn `17dd464` completed under
out/platform-v1-storage-build; eight QEMU userspace checks and the installed ARM
1k database/scanner/UI benchmark pass. Its first production test run exposed the
locked host libc's lack of the obsolete off64_t name in the test-only ENOSPC shim;
`44cf4ac` uses the explicit 64-bit ABI type. Rerun is required and recorded below.
Phase-3 sources are not covered by this earlier ARM receipt.

### Bluetooth observation and AVRCP foundation

DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED: native read-only D-Bus observer, typed exact PCM
and runtime/mutual capability distinctions, generated build codec inventory that
rejects unexpected optional encoder enablement. Four focused host tests pass,
including native C compilation/private D-Bus missing-owner execution, peer loss,
wrong direction, owner change, unsupported format and accidental AAC enablement.
AVRCP in Reborn routes only approved BlueZ calls through semantic Actions; two
host tests include real private D-Bus registration, control delivery, metadata
projection and unauthorized-sender rejection. ARM/image proof follows later.

The phase-2 production rerun with current host/tooling source passed 32 platform,
67 production and 38 subsystem tests, plus ARM ABI/ALSA utility smoke. This does
not promote phase-3 sources to ARM_BUILT: their separate fresh build is ongoing at
Linux `ea50d53` / Reborn `ce55f89`, out/platform-v1-services-build.

The phase-3 services build (`ea50d53` / `ce55f89`) completed fresh kernel,
Buildroot ARM, Reborn ARM, FFmpeg/package/ELF validation. Its 32 platform,
67 production, 38 subsystem tests and eight QEMU userspace checks passed.
Receipts are in out/platform-v1-services-build. No physical qualification.

Reconnect now has bounded attempts, persistent same-boot inhibition, shared
user/automatic operation exclusion, and unknown-completion containment. Native
host compilation and six Bluetooth tests pass; Reborn's 34 platform tests pass.
These newer Bluetooth changes still need the next fresh ARM/image receipt.

Codec Auto has a typed eligibility/session policy and actual SelectCodec control
path through Reborn, plus stopped-playback/shared-PCM exclusion. Two policy tests
exercise gate/fallback/peer generation/deadline/unknown-completion bounds; the
real file-lock test proves open PCM and selection exclude each other. Requested
codec never overwrites negotiated PCM. Optional codecs remain unbuilt and
distribution-gated, not claimed implemented. See platform-bluetooth-v1.md.

### USB owner transfer and listener security

DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED: supervised USB-interface-bound key-only SSH,
kernel-CRNG startup gate, pinned OpenSSH SFTP subsystem with per-write reserve,
private staged/hash-verified/durable/no-replace upload helper. Four contract tests
cover interruption/hash/space/identity/symlink/old-FD mutation and SSH prerequisites.
The actual patched native SFTP server passed protocol write/close/readback,
injected low-space refusal and abrupt session termination. Receipt:
/tmp/y2linux-platform-v1-pass/sftp-host-check.json (to be retained in candidate).
ARM/image checks follow. ECM cross-OS, reconnect/sleep/transfer and VBUS/role
hardware remain PHYSICAL_GATE. No USB mass-storage or host path is enabled.

### Signed staged root update and verified rescue restore

DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED: native Ed25519/json-c/gzip verification in normal
system and immutable rescue; strict root-only/kernel/schema/key policy; bounded
HTTPS/local private staging; controller/geometry/exclusive offline writer;
actual previous-root backup verified before mutation; fsync/readback, durable
journal, exact boot/source/first-frame health and next-boot rollback. Development
public trust provisioned; private key exists only outside repositories/artifacts.
No BOOTIMG writer. Key rotation/revocation explicitly requires the trusted rescue
boundary. See `architecture/platform-update-v1.md` for limitations and commands.

Seven actual C/authentication/stream/staging host fault tests pass, plus ten
observation and six PID1 handover tests (including torn-root recovery ordering).
Reborn's readiness/capability source passed 37 platform and 27 runtime tests and
the library benchmark CLI test. No physical/block device was opened. ARM/image
validation for USB/OTA/readiness is pending a new paired build.

The Bluetooth build at `1f54bd0` / `87a46cb` completed kernel, Buildroot ARM,
Reborn ARM, FFmpeg/artifact checks, eight QEMU userspace checks and production
suites: 38 platform cases (one host dependency case skipped in the locked host;
covered separately on the maintainer host), 67 production and 38 subsystem cases.
This receipt is `out/platform-v1-bluetooth-build`; USB/OTA code is newer.

### Scoped maintenance and private export

DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED: distinct settings/network/bonds/library/cache/full
logical user reset; confirmation bound to exact scope and inode inventory,
quiescent consumer checks, durable quarantine, interrupted-reset startup hold,
new-boot resume and explicit bounded purge. SSH/entropy/update/factory/unknown
state is preserved. Full logical reset is not secure erasure. Private export
includes consistent SQLite backup optionally; WPA credentials require a flag,
private keys and Bluetooth bonds are excluded. Five meaningful host tests pass,
plus the seven updater tests. Reborn `41214d0` exposes its own settings defaults
and refuses normal startup during unfinished maintenance; 27 runtime tests pass.
ARM/image validation follows separately. See platform-maintenance-v1.md.

### Integrated endurance and candidate reconstruction

DONE_SOFTWARE / HOST_VALIDATED: owner-controlled passive qualification profiles,
exact pair checks, USB disconnect gaps, PID/boot/source generation separation,
resource/counter analysis and no automatic physical/endurance acceptance. Reborn
PID selection follows restarts; telemetry exposes actual CONSYS/taint without
inventing warning/loss counts. Six qualification/measurement tests pass, including
actual SQLite faults; 30 combined focused release/evidence/receipt cases pass.
The sessions A–G plan is `PLATFORM-V1-OWNER-QUALIFICATION.md`.

Release identity, package contract validation, pinned Rust archive inventory and
full selected-package/source/footprint inventory are prepared for the final fresh
build. No package was removed on a guessed dependency or image-size basis.
Byte-for-byte reproducibility, current-image physical and endurance qualification
remain unclaimed. `build/platform-v1-reconstruction.md` records the exact source,
owner firmware, signing, privilege and distribution boundaries.
