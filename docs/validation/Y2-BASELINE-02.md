# Baseline02 integrated preserving candidate

## Sealed build receipt — 2026-10-03

PASS for fresh build and software/package validation. The compiled source and
artifact identities below are the current sealed Baseline02 record. Exact new-image hardware
and automatic cold-boot qualification remain **NOT_RUN**. Prior UART01 C1/C2/C3
architecture remains physically qualified; it is the unchanged paired rollback.

Package: `out/y2linux-baseline-02-candidate/`.
Exact owner handoff (`out/y2linux-baseline-02-candidate/BASELINE-02-OWNER-HANDOFF.md`, local-only),
seal and check exits (`out/baseline-02-validation/final-seal.json`, local-only),
installed boot-policy bytes (`out/baseline-02-validation/boot-policy-installed.json`, local-only),
live ARM control proof (`out/baseline-02-validation/live-policy-control.json`, local-only),
closing installed-device read (`out/baseline-02-validation/closing-hardware.json`, local-only).

Fresh kernel/config/DT/modules/ABI and ARM Buildroot/Reborn pass. The integrated
suite has 391 cases: 386 passed and 5 minimal-environment dependency skips,
covered separately by 27 native filesystem/GIO, 3 ALSA and installed ARM checks.
All 125 focused source tests and 238 Reborn tests/fmt/lint pass, as do Cortex-A7 QEMU, installed
ARM platform/application/codecs, ELF/dependencies, source/license collection,
filesystem/privacy, preservation and final sealed-package checks. Collector
limitations and owner-local distribution status remain explicit in the package.

New production behavior: S05y2-cpu-idle verifies static foundations, then reads
back qualified budget-1/CPU0 enable once each boot. The kernel starts quarantined.
No CPU1–3 C3 enable, forced parking/OPP/radio change, UART gate or weakening of
entry/fault guards. Boot-policy JSON in status CPU records exact rejection;
write/readback/receipt failure closes admission. Manual stop is respected by
subsequent starts. Recovery: `y2.deep_idle=off` / `y2.cpu_safe=1`, or
`y2-platform cpu-idle-policy stop` for this boot. The guarded harness checks real
automatic activation before it quarantines C3 for its foundation/trial phases.

Closing SSH verifies the old installed UART01 source, same boot/taint0 and3647
C3 returns with zero UART timeout/restore failure. No new image was installed.
Only the owner flashes: load MT6582_preserve_data_scatter.txt, Download Only,
select BOOTIMG and ANDROID/Y2ROOT only, preserve USRDATA/Y2DATA and every protected
partition. Then boot and confirm installation for the included automatic SSH
qualification. No push or flash was performed. Full system suspend, additional
wake sources/endurance and electrical battery measurement remain unqualified.

Local source commits:5fec95e (baseline identity/preparation),8584ccd (automatic
qualified boot policy and harness/fault tests). The later documentation receipt
commit is not the compiled kernel/root source. Historical preparation below and
source-era package documentation are superseded by this sealed receipt and the
packaged manifest/owner handoff. The interrupted default-off draft made no package;
its logs remain under validation/draft-default-off/. Initial native test-path
probe history is preserved under pre-freeze-probes/; final fresh checks pass.

## Repository documentation synchronization — 2026-10-03

Entry pages, current state/candidate/capability summaries, roadmap, power/API
contracts, maintained knowledge, release guides and the 233-feature Markdown/JSON
inventory now follow this sealed baseline and the exact UART01 hardware proof.
The catalog indexes all 289 Linux Markdown pages; 4,329 local links have zero
problems. The adjacent Reborn check also passes (58 pages / 563 links).

All 27 documentation/structure/preservation checks pass, including matrix/JSON
parity, feature enums/references, 49 overlays against the active manifest,
historical census retention, all-page scope, preexisting owner edits and raw
capture preservation. `git diff --check` passes. Baseline02 manifest/checksum
inventory hashes remain identical to the seal. Private check receipt:
`out/docs-baseline02-sync/validation.json` (local-only).

This update changes no implementation, package bytes, runtime flags or physical
acceptance. No build, device test, flash, push or repeat of unchanged stock/recovery
provenance occurs. Historical reports remain at their original paths and retain
their exact-image PASS/FAIL/NOT_RUN results.

## Historical preparation snapshot — superseded by the sealed receipt

The following preparation text records the pre-seal plan. “Pending”, “will”
and harness-order statements below are historical; the sealed receipt above
and packaged harness govern current behavior.

Owner requested a new latest-source baseline on2026-10-03 after UART01
hardware qualification. Candidate preparation is authorized; flashing and
pushing are excluded. All current Linux changes and Rebornb71b4688 are included;
the only new production behavior is the owner-selected automatic C3 boot policy.
There is no new CPU architecture, memory/layout or data-schema change.

Build `Y2LINUX-BASELINE-02`; kernel `6.18.0-y2linux-baseline-02`;
root `2025.02.18-platform-v1.21`; release `1.0.0-baseline-candidate.2`.
Only BOOTIMG and ANDROID/Y2ROOT are payloads; preserve Y2DATA and all protected
partitions. Fallback retains the exact physically qualified UART01 pair.

C1, C2 and C3 architecture is physically qualified on the preceding UART01
image: four-core WFI, C2+6971entries/84.35%,21 bounded reset-and-return C3
trials and+3624 normal-policy entries/65.25%, all checked context/timer/CIRQ/
clock/storage restores clean. See [authoritative hardware record](Y2-CPU-C3-UART-PHYSICAL.md).
Read-only admission reconfirms same boot/taint0/3647 C3 returns. This evidence
is inherited architecture evidence, not physical acceptance of new images.
The new package remains PHYSICAL_NOT_RUN until owner installation and checks.

Owner selects automatic qualified C3 after boot. Kernel registration still
starts quarantined/default-off/budget0. `S05y2-cpu-idle` applies the qualified
policy once after static identity/SPM/CIRQ/context/timer foundations pass:
budget-1, then CPU0 state2 enable, both read back. A failed write rolls back.
All dynamic topology/OPP/screen/workload/radio/USB/clock/deadline/UART ACK and
restore-failure guards remain unchanged. No active device or clock is forced.
Repeated startup respects a later manual disable. Recovery boot options remain
`y2.deep_idle=off` and `y2.cpu_safe=1`; `y2-platform cpu-idle-policy stop` closes
C3 for this boot. Status CPU exposes the boot-policy result/rejection.

The packaged harness first disables C3 before foundation qualification and
uses21 bounded checked reset-and-return trials before runtime observation.
New persistent cold-boot behavior is NOT_RUN until owner installation. This
does not qualify full system suspend, battery life or wider endurance.

Fresh build/validation and seal receipts will be recorded under
`out/baseline-02-validation/`. Final package:
`out/y2linux-baseline-02-candidate/`. Existing historical candidate directories
are immutable. No source or userspace build outputs are reused.

Automatic policy source tests and live ARM control/readback transaction pass.
Live test uses the same qualified UART01 boot and restores original budget-1/
CPU0 enable; it is not a new-image cold-boot test. `/run` evidence is transient;
no boot-time polling, persistent data record or radio/OPP/hotplug change is added.
Failed activation rolls back, failed foundations stay quarantined and subsequent
start cannot replace an owner's runtime control. Foundation and runtime behavior
remain distinct: normal activity can legitimately reject individual C3 attempts.
