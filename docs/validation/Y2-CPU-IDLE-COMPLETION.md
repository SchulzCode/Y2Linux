## Baseline02 scope and current evidence

[Baseline02](Y2-BASELINE-02.md) is now the newest sealed candidate with automatic qualified CPU0 C3
startup. New-image/cold-boot hardware remains PHYSICAL_NOT_RUN. The
[UART01 physical receipt](Y2-CPU-C3-UART-PHYSICAL.md) proves bounded C1/C2/C3 on its exact installed pair.
Default-off, UART blocker, pending-flash and harness preparation statements
below retain their recorded image/session scope. They do not describe the new
Baseline02 startup policy or reopen the solved UART01 architecture. This report's
original exact-image evidence is preserved; full system suspend and battery
measurements remain separate.


## UART01 installed hardware result — 2026-10-03

**C1 WORKING; C2 WORKING; C3 WORKING_AND_REPEATEDLY_OBSERVED.** The owner

Boot `fd955840-35d9-47db-83e0-ff47d6bb2d2b` and taint0 remain unchanged.
Source HEADc8ae170 is a later harness fix; installed kernel/source archives and
both sealed payload hashes are unchanged. No new images or flash are needed.

- All five OPPs,18 hotplug transitions, eMMC/inserted-SD checksums, screen/
  workload/playback wake and USB/independent Wi-Fi integrity pass; no new
  filesystem/IRQ fault. GPT6/GPT4/PPI29/CNTFRQ13MHz/highres/NO_HZ remain valid.

UART1 remains clocked: source-backed PIO sleep ownership/global SPM request/
ACK permits real DPIDLE without forcing its PERI gate. Two observer defects
were corrected locally: fsynced evidence must precede a read-only stable MMC/
prerequisite window; admission counters also include safe pre/post-entry guard
refusals. EXACTLY one real entry/return/ACK per bounded cycle is still required,
with stronger SRAM reset marker and all original restore guards. Original raw
FAIL receipts are retained alongside independent successful rechecks.
33 targeted harness/CPU/UART tests pass; no kernel rebuild is needed for these
host qualification corrections. Fresh candidate build validation remains375
integrated/source109/native host/Reborn238/ARM/QEMU/config/DT/modules/ABI/ELF/
package checks as recorded in the historical handoff below.

C3 is enabled with normal budget-1 **for the current boot**. Original screen,
Wi-Fi/BT, schedutil598–1300MHz and coordinator settings are restored; RGU is
unarmed. Fresh boots retain image default-off/budget0. Persistent default-on,
full system suspend, endurance, additional wake sources and electrical battery
improvement are not qualified by this pass. No flash/push or owner-data wipe.

The following sealed handoff and candidate02 sections are **historical**; their
NOT_RUN/never-entered/owner-flash statements do not describe the current device.

## UART01 sealed software handoff — 2026-10-03

**C3 SOFTWARE_READY_NEEDS_NEW_FLASH. New candidate physical NOT_RUN.**
Owner flash is the remaining boundary. C3 has never been entered on the
connected candidate02; neither hardware failure nor hardware impossibility
is established. C1/C2 physical working results are preserved.

Fresh kernel/Buildroot/Reborn ARM and config/DT/modules/ABI checks pass.
Production suite375 cases: five minimal-host dependency skips are covered by
native filesystem/GIO/ALSA tests and ARM compilation/query. Extended source
contracts109, native packaging/filesystem/GIO27, ALSA evidence3 and Reborn238
cases pass; formatting/Clippy, Cortex-A7 QEMU, installed ARM helpers and ELF
checks pass. Preserving package, source seal (445 source/license files) and
sealed-image validation pass. Collector limitations remain recorded; this is
an owner-local package, not public distribution approval.

Only BOOTIMG/ANDROID payloads and accepted candidate02 fallback BOOTIMG/ROOT
are packaged; no Y2DATA, preloader/LK/NVRAM/PROTECT/calibration/table payload.

Owner action: use `MT6582_preserve_data_scatter.txt`, Download Only, selecting
BOOTIMG.img and ANDROID/Y2ROOT.img. Preserve existing Y2DATA. Boot normally,
then confirm installation; the prepared SSH harness will verify identity and
preserved regressions, attempt one25ms RGU/SRAM/budget1 timer wake, and allow20
further cycles only after real UART ACK and all same-boot restore checks pass.
The packaged `CPU-C3-UART-OWNER-HANDOFF.md` gives the exact invocation.
C3 stays default disabled/budget0 until the guarded physical test. No flash or
push was performed; six preexisting owner doc edits remain unstaged.

expected prior probe taint4096. It contains no new UART handshake or deep wake.

## C3 UART admission software correction — 2026-10-03

Candidate02's C1/C2 WORKING results remain valid; C3 has never entered.
Exact MT6582 sources show UART1 is in the default blocker mask but PIO UART
owners conditionally permit their clock and enable sleep before the global
SPM request/ACK. This missing integration is now corrected with guarded
ownership,100us ACK refusal, exact restore and diagnostics. No gate/FIFO/
data/baud/reset write, unrelated guard removal or C1/C2 redesign is added.
The new source/candidate boundary remains **SOFTWARE_READY_NEEDS_NEW_FLASH**;
no hardware ACK or DORMANT success is claimed. See
[Y2-CPU-C3-UART.md](Y2-CPU-C3-UART.md) and
[Y2-CPU-C3-UART-PHYSICAL.md](Y2-CPU-C3-UART-PHYSICAL.md).

## Candidate02 installed hardware result — 2026-10-03

The owner-installed candidate02 is now physically tested. **C1 WORKING,
C2 WORKING; C3 BLOCKED BEFORE ENTRY BY UART1. Overall acceptance FAILS C3.**
This supersedes candidate02 NOT_RUN/SOFTWARE_READY_NEEDS_NEW_FLASH and its
installation instruction below; the sealed images have already been flashed.
No exact hardware limit is established and no dormant success is claimed.

`f155196b-64d4-45a4-88b3-27755a1a8926`. Every installed manifest axis matches.
The [physical receipt](Y2-CPU-IDLE-COMPLETION-PHYSICAL.md) contains full counters,
individual prerequisites, sources, limitations and restored state. Raw evidence:
`out/cpu-idle-completion-physical/20261003T144857Z-candidate02/`.

- Four-core WFI entries+725/+923/+1695/+669, residency advances, rejections0.
- Natural CPU0/owner0xe parking; C2+6772 entries/+50.669913s in60.048084s
  (84.38%), clock restore failures0.
- Three hotplug cycles/18 physically checked transitions; all five OPPs before/
  after preflight, timer continuity, both media integrity, screen/playback and
  USB/independent Wi-Fi observation pass.
- Installed SPI0 STATUS1=1 now correctly releases the gate. Settled C3 preflight
  has only PERI UART1 bit17/0x20000 unmet; CPU0, both physical secondary power
  copies, domains,747.5MHz and all other exposed static predicates pass.
- Actual dormant calls/entries/resumes/residency0. GPT4 dormant deadline,
  CIRQ/GIC/context/MMU/VFP/cache/coherency return and20 wake cycles unexercised.

The full harness first caught a second issue: synced storage demand restores
cores after its C2 window, so C3 must wait for normal parking again. The device
helper now requires CPU0/owner0xe/both secondary power copies clear for20s after
sync/USB detach, before budget/backstop/preflight. It uses sparse durable progress
writes and rejects timeout/boot change without arming entry. Two new behavioral
tests cover ownership, both physical copies and safe failures; the existing
first-failed-cycle quarantine test remains. Fresh locked-host CPU90,
slow-idle/suspend-policy8 and workload QoS2 cases pass; dedicated host
harness/completion21 cases pass. The supplementary physical settled run validates
the topology requirement, while the edited full harness is not repeated against
the known UART1 blocker.

Exact-kernel, nonresident diagnostic probes establish UART1 reset0/0,
sleep/FCR_RD/ACTIVE_EN/IRQ/DMA/LSR0 and DLL1/DLH0; the temporary divisor bank
selection restores LCR exactly. Their native guard/failure19 cases and ARM
builds pass. These observations do not justify treating LSR0 as drained or
forcing its clock off. No production clock guard/reset changes follow. Normal
CCF references balance, no resident probe remains; the final expected diagnostic
out-of-tree taint4096 is recorded. Main qualification/settled preflight were
taint0; no C3 trial occurs under diagnostic scope.

Only the host/device qualification helper, its tests and evidence/roadmap/release
records change this turn. Kernel/rootfs binaries and sealed package are unchanged;
fresh payload recheck matches the hashes below. No new candidate, flash or push.
Normal controls restore, C3 off/budget0/backstop disarmed, ext4/MMC errors0.
Playback stays stopped because the original paused selection referenced an
already deleted historical fixture. Full-system suspend and electrical battery
benefit remain unqualified. Next boundary is exact safe UART1 ownership closure
before any bounded dormant trial; there is no new owner flash action this turn.

## Candidate02 sealed software handoff — 2026-10-03

Hardware tests are complete on installed candidate01: **C1 WORKING, C2 WORKING,
C3 blocked before entry by UART1/SPI0**. No C3 entry/resume/restoration success
is claimed. Same boot`e0eb2f36-7c1f-4007-99e2-81d2eae047d4`, taint0, mounted
media errors0; final receipt restores screen/radio/USB/DVFS/coordinator state.
The failed clock preflight led to the guarded source fixes below and one coherent
follow-up. Candidate02 C3 category: **SOFTWARE_READY_NEEDS_NEW_FLASH**. This means
ready for controlled qualification; whether its guards clear both retained
engines remains unobserved. It is not proof of a hardware limit or C3 acceptance.

Latest candidate: **`out/y2linux-cpu-idle-completion-02-candidate/`**. The installed
candidate01 at`out/y2linux-cpu-idle-completion-candidate/` remains unchanged.

Fresh kernel/config/DT/modules/ARM ABI and Buildroot/Reborn ARM pass. The fresh
full build preceded the final late-handoff review; all affected components and
local ARM packages were rebuilt from frozen db0234e afterward, with a new root
image and matching identities. No reused userspace/root image. Production366
cases:361 pass in the locked host, five explicit native prerequisite skips;
all five are covered by30 native packaging/evidence cases with no skips.

383 ARM ELF files/1403 dependency edges, inventory/legal-info, preserving/root/
package composition/privacy/source/checksum validation pass. Unchanged pinned
third-party inputs are retained; software checks do not establish C3 hardware.
Receipts:`out/cpu-idle-completion-02-validation/` and package`validation/`.
The unsealed inventory initially rejected newly attached harness files; it was
refreshed before successful source sealing and final validation. No rejected
staging package was handed off or flashed.

Only BOOTIMG+ANDROID/Y2ROOT are new payloads. Y2DATA remains in place; no
preloader/LK/NVRAM/PROTECT/calibration/factory/table payload. Exact Hardware02
fallback is retained. New source files in this follow-up: clocks.c/clocks.h,
idle-clock-policy.h/system-idle.c, production config/release metadata,
observe.py and test_cpu_idle_completion.py, plus the linked validation/release/
roadmap records. Preexisting six owner documentation edits remain separate.
Local source commits:`143fab1` (SPI/UART decisions/diagnostics/physical record),
`db0234e` (late handoff/clear-on-read protection/CCF fault tests). Reborn is
unchanged from the integrated b71b4688 DRM ownership fix.

**Exact next owner action:** install only this candidate02's BOOTIMG and
ANDROID/Y2ROOT using its preserving scatter, keep USRDATA/Y2DATA unselected,
then report installation. The agent will run the bundled guarded SSH harness
once: all prerequisite checks, one bounded entry, then19 further cycles only
on success, failure quarantine and independent regressions. The package's
`CPU-IDLE-OWNER-HANDOFF.md` also provides the one-command option. No flash/push
was performed. Full-system suspend and electrical battery benefit stay separate.

## Candidate01 hardware result and candidate02 follow-up — 2026-10-03

The installed candidate01 is now physically tested, Linux3dfb5f5/Rebornb71b4688,
boot `e0eb2f36-7c1f-4007-99e2-81d2eae047d4`. **C1 and C2 WORKING; C3 blocked
before entry by UART1/SPI0 clocks. Overall qualification FAIL.** C2 adds7,040
entries/49.674049s in60.047965s (82.72%); restore/storage errors0. Hotplug,
parking, all five OPPs, screen/workload wake, real playback and USB/Wi-Fi pass.
Detailed [physical record](Y2-CPU-IDLE-COMPLETION-PHYSICAL.md) supersedes the old
"not run" handoff statement below. No actual dormant entry or battery measurement.

The clock owners retained two unsupported loader engines, with no Linux
consumer/CCF reference. Candidate01 exposes neither raw handoff decision. We
cannot infer UART's exact field or prove that software fixes below release both
clocks until another owner flash. No supported installed control owns those
engines, so no safe runtime clock forcing is available or attempted.

Source-backed candidate02 changes are limited to the existing unused-clock
owner, diagnostics and regression tests:

- SPI CMD+0x18/STATUS1+0x20: the pinned MT6582 vendor `spi_is_busy` helper says
  STATUS1 bit0=1 is idle. Candidate01 wrongly rejected all nonzero status and
  accepted0. Accept exactly1 only with no ACT/RESUME/reset/pause/DMA operands;
  keep unknown status/active engines. STATUS0+0x1c is clear-on-read and is never
  sampled. The corroborating helper is commented in these BSPs; this is source
  interpretation, not an observed Y2 status value or completed physical fix.
- UART DMA_EN+0x4c: exact MT6582 defines RX/TX DMA bits0/1 and timeout-counter
  auto-reset metadata bit2. Metadata alone no longer falsely implies DMA.
  IRQ-enabled, DLAB/alternate bank, RX data, incomplete TX, line/FIFO errors and
  unknown DMA/status bits remain blocked. No UART interrupt/FIFO/DMA reset/write.
- Sample known operands only while their inherited clock is enabled, retain
  the boot/latest idle recheck in a read-only `clocks/unused_handoff` diagnostic with reason names, and
  surface it in `y2-platform status cpu`. DLAB/alternate banks are retained
  without reading aliased IER/LSR fields; live IRQ/DMA owners are not disturbed
  by clear-on-read LSR, and already gated engines are not read.
- Partial NAND/PWM clock handoff retains its gate rather than returning a
  probe-aborting error for the entire shared CCF provider. Real allocation/
  mapping errors still fail provider registration.

The unused-clock owner also rechecks retained UART1–3/SPI0 through the existing
CPU0-only, screen-off, lease-free deferrable worker, only with both radios
physically off. It borrows/releases through CCF, keeps IRQ/DMA/unknown engines,
never reads gated or aliased windows, avoids live UART clear-on-read LSR, and
quarantines a failed gate readback. A transient loader operation no longer pins
its clock forever. No new timer, coordinator-policy/hysteresis change or reset.
Native fault tests cover real refs, still-busy engines, unavailable domains,
unclocked skips, allocation/borrow and gate-readback failures.

Masks, C1/C2 algorithms, MMC high-speed/runtime PM, timer broadcast, PCM,
CIRQ/context/coherency, coordinator hysteresis, guarded OPPs and ABI remain
unchanged. New tests exercise genuine busy/unknown/metadata/idle states, aliased
banks, clear-on-read avoidance and partial provider handoff. Candidate02 uses
kernel`6.18.0-y2linux-cpu-idle-02`, root`2025.02.18-platform-v1.19`, release
`1.0.0-cpu-idle-completion-candidate.2`, build`Y2LINUX-CPU-IDLE-COMPLETION-02`.
Fresh build/qualification and exact candidate hashes are recorded at sealing.

## Physically established foundation

[Raw qualification and results](Y2-CPU-IDLE-COMPLETION-PHYSICAL.md): C1 WORKING
on all four CPUs. C2 WORKING after natural parking:7182 additional entries,
50.763741s residency in60.404076s, exact clock restore failures0, eMMC/SD integrity
and timer continuity. Freeze both algorithms and the proven MMC transport/PM
patch; do not import the reverted later storage experiment. Three hotplug cycles
prove both physical power-status copies; all five guarded OPPs and real wired
playback pass. Historical full-system suspend failure remains a separate gate.

it does not reduce active performance. No root/data reset, partition/memory
layout change, /dev/mem, userspace MMIO, firmware invention or clock-bit masking.

## Exact source ledger and confidence

The retained Y2 PCM, CIRQ/context/SPM disassembly and prior source ledger are
reused rather than repeatedly recapturing unchanged ROM/recovery provenance.
[CPU Final source ledger](Y2-CPU-FINAL-SOURCES.md) names retained function/offset
and independent binary matching. Additional narrow downloads and SHA256 receipts
are in `out/cpu-idle-completion-research/manifest.json`.

- [Google MT6582 d53dd75c BSP](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/arch/arm/mach-mt6582/): `mt_idle.c` full clock masks/minimum26000ticks, `mt_spm_sleep.c` runtime DPIDLE480 words (distinct from SODI/system PCM), `mt_dormant.c` and `cpu_dormant.S` CA7/BIU/L2 context, `mt_cirq.c` exact bank map and clone/replay. Direct exact-SoC evidence, independently retained-Y2 matched.

- [MT6582 clock manager](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/arch/arm/mach-mt6582/mt_clkmgr.c): named PERI/INFRA/DISP gates and `cg_bootup_pdn`0xb0e0/0x2fef7fd. The bring-up shutdown routine is evidence that these are clock gates used while the CPU executes; applying it to unconsumed Linux idle/test clocks is an explicit inference, not evidence of arbitrary L2 power control. CA7 SRAM-retention configuration is separate and unchanged.
- [MT6582 USB PHY](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/drivers/misc/mediatek/usb20/mt6582/usb20_phy.c): `usb_enable_clock` owns MT_CG_PERI_USB0 through balanced clock-manager operations; physical supported-role receipt corroborates the missing Linux owner.
- [MT6582 display register/engine sources](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/drivers/misc/mediatek/dispsys/mt6582/): `ddp_cmdq.c`, `ddp_cmdq_debug.c`, `ddp_reg.h`, `ddp_bls.c`, `dpi_reg.h`, WDMA/RSZ/TDSHP sources. WROT ROT_EN+0x7c is explicitly named by debug code; reset status+0x14 alone is insufficient. RDMA idle monitor+0x408 mask0x7ff00=0x100 is used before clock disable. CMDQ has seven thread enables; DPI EN/status offsets0/0x40, LARB GREQ0x450, BLS bits0/16. These are exact MT6582 operands; unsupported activity always retains clocks.
- [BQ/ubports MT6582 NAND](https://github.com/ubports/kernel_krillin/blob/874057f3c28735d606385361fb9a4cd4545ceba6/mediatek/platform/mt6582/kernel/drivers/nand/mtk_nand.c): `nand_enable_clock`/`nand_disable_clock` owns both NFI and NLI; MT6582-path `mt6575_nand.h` defines MASTERSTA+0x210, CON+8, STA+0x60, FIFO+0x64. Legacy filename does not change actual SoC relevance.
- [MT6582 PWM](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/drivers/misc/mediatek/pwm/mt6582/mt_pwm_hal.c) and [SPI](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/drivers/misc/mediatek/spi/mt6582/spi.c): exact activity operands.

- [Cortex-A7 TRM](https://documentation-service.arm.com/static/5f042da1dbdee951c1cd8c11): dormant/reset/coherency/cache constraints, with Linux's own A7 implementation supplying the port. [Linux v6.18 ARM suspend](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/arm/kernel/suspend.c?h=v6.18), `sleep.S` and `proc-v7.S` are the locked local code; generic save block is36+12bytes, actual stash/physical-idmap and reset-return ownership are used directly.

## Automated next physical qualification

Run the single host harness after owner flash. Default displays a plan without
contacting hardware. `--run` verifies exact manifest and running Reborn identity,
then launches one durable private device job. A mutation is launched exactly
once even if SSH disappears; only read-only observations retry over independently
pinned Wi-Fi. Sparse observers preserve idle windows. If both transports are
intentionally off, the device job continues and restores supported USB role and
radios in finally. An RGU reset is a failed trial, captured from retained stage,
not a successful same-boot wake; there is no automatic reflash/retry.

The harness covers GPT6/GPT4/PPI29/highres/NO_HZ receipts and per-core1ms wake,
three physical hotplug cycles, all five bounded OPPs, screen-on/off metrics,
natural quiet/ownership parking, C2 useful residency/restore, fsynced uncached
SHA256 on eMMC and whichever SD is actually inserted, all C3 prerequisites,
too-close deadlines, one checked C3 timer-wake followed by19 only after success,
context/timer/CIRQ/GPT wake checks, screen/workload wake, real silent playback,
USB bidirectional1MiB SHA256 transfers with independent Wi-Fi observation,
filesystem/kernel IRQ faults and thermal state. It restores owner policies;
`--enable-qualified-runtime` leaves C3 enabled through ordinary cpuidle policy
only after20 successful bounded trials and an additional runtime-residency window.

It does not automatically remove SD or create a radio peer, and does not claim
physical external input-edge latch qualification from a synthetic key injection.
All such unobserved scenarios stay explicit. No electrical battery improvement
is claimed. Full-system suspend is excluded from this CPU-only runner because
its historical resume defect is a separate owner scope and hardware gate.

## Software qualification and package

Final clean source pair **3dfb5f5cc731ec5dac88a778290819c23dba6067 / b71b468860233faa0a42b8448ec5777fa952b8e3** produces
kernel `6.18.0-y2linux-cpu-idle-01`, root `2025.02.18-platform-v1.18`, release
`1.0.0-cpu-idle-completion-candidate.1` and build `Y2LINUX-CPU-IDLE-COMPLETION-01`. Kernel/config/DT/module/
rescue/ARM ABI validation, fresh Buildroot/Reborn ARM, FFmpeg verification,
QEMU, installed ARM tools, ELF/dependencies, complete regression suite and
preserving-package validation pass. No baseline userspace binaries were reused.

Production runner: **364 cases**:359 pass in the locked
host and five explicit native prerequisite skips. All five skipped assertions
pass in the packaging-host follow-up (25 cases, no skips), yielding364 covered
production cases. Reborn workspace **238 pass,0 ignored**, clippy/fmt pass;
source owner/fault suite98 pass. Installed ARM imports31 platform modules,
SQLite3.53.4/OpenSSL3.5.8, null-device audio constraints12 combinations, real
1000-track ARM library benchmark and eight Reborn control/QEMU checks pass.
ELF verification covers383 ARM files and1403 dependency edges without build
RPATHs. QEMU and null-device checks are software evidence, not Y2 hardware tests.

Actual receipts/logs: `out/cpu-idle-completion-validation/` and the sealed
package's `validation/`. Pinned source hashes/dependency inventory, notices and
exact committed source archives are included. Buildroot legal-info succeeds;
its existing local-package/external-toolchain notice omissions are retained
explicitly in the receipt, with paired source/licenses and pinned inventory.
Owner-local distribution scope is unchanged; no public distribution is asserted.

Final preserving package: **`out/y2linux-cpu-idle-completion-candidate/`**.
Only BOOTIMG and ANDROID/Y2ROOT are supplied as new flash payloads; Y2DATA is
preserved in place. The exact Hardware02 fallback is retained. Full ext4/root
content, module/identity/dependency, scatter/preservation/composition/privacy
and complete checksum inventory checks pass. No flash or push occurred.

| Payload | Bytes | SHA256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| BOOTIMG.img | 7208960 | `3303cad8d0b73a78653f58d80ede2d1583ed7ef89a48f781f8aaf1669240092d` |
| Y2ROOT.img | 536870912 | `816b9a271633c96fd937fa71ef1ac1f93e74436fbd8e97c9d0491470cc4babbb` |

C3 physical category: **SOFTWARE_READY_NEEDS_NEW_FLASH**. Current installed
DORMANT entry/success/residency remain0; no actual CPU0 power-off/resume has
been observed. Source-ready software does not promote the candidate's physical
acceptance. The baseline C1/C2 results stay attached to their real identities.

Fresh ARM linking caught a64-bit diagnostic division using an unavailable
userspace runtime symbol; the kernel variant now uses div_u64 while native
fixtures retain identical13MHz arithmetic. This was corrected before a complete
build or candidate was packaged. Baseline receipt18 adds three bidirectional
1MiB USB SHA256 passes with an independently reachable Wi-Fi observer.

Final source fault review adds fail-closed partial-DPI handoff (no unclocked
partner register read), counted/quarantined CIRQ enable-readback failure, and
all-five-OPP qualification again after C3 before restoring schedutil for the
actual playback test. Native dropped-clone/enable writes and partial coupled
clock fixtures pass. These refinements precede final packaging/qualification.

The final hardware harness distinguishes stable dormant_wake_result/stage from
subsequent admission refusals: a spent positive budget may legitimately refuse
more idle attempts without erasing the observed wake. Native tests explicitly
cover successful reset return followed by budget refusal, and restoration faults.
DT validation now admits only exact USB0 ID44 on the USB consumer, preserving
existing profile ceilings for every other consumer and requiring the four exact
MT6582 mutex/shared-clock specifiers. Invalid IDs/providers remain rejected.

The bounded dormant journal appends restoration stages for PCM, CPU/cache/GIC,
CIRQ and clocks without changing existing stage IDs, retained record layout or
memory ownership. Normal unlimited idle does not pay qualification journal/
watchdog overhead. The host harness checks the physically demonstrated descending
MT6582 secondary power bits0x800/0x400/0x200; the kernel mapping was already correct.

## Completion handoff record

1. **Installed baseline.** Kernel6.18.0-y2linux-baseline-01; Linux
   131ee4621cd583c955182f994adac5a594fb823f; Reborn
   7f9df397ab3809d52e2f1073ca93a305246e0c3a; boot
   cee326c1-a5b0-447a-8eb0-dc3f39f7e2c2. Rootv1.17/releasebaseline.1 match
   the sealed baseline package. Both Git status/HEAD/log80 snapshots precede changes.
2. **C1.** Stock WFI and existing Linux cpuidle fallback preserved. All four
   cores registered/enabled;3902 new entries and48.146279 aggregate core-seconds,
   rejections0. Per-core results and wake percentiles are in the physical record.
3. **C2.** Initial live mask0x100800: APDMA bit11 and BTIF bit20 owned by active
   connectivity, legitimate with Wi-Fi running. Initial MMC references are
   real I/O and drain normally; no new MMC ownership leak exists in this baseline.
   Radio runtime-off removes these blockers; natural pressure-hold expiry gives
   CPU0 eligibility. Existing Fix03 exact0/0x0f bus DCM save/0x8f/restore remains.
   No blocker mask was removed.7182 new entries/50.763741s, restore failures0;
   enabled/disabled/re-enabled comparison proves meaningful residency.
4. **Core parking.** Existing sustained-load/high-frequency/30-second quiet
   policy, pressure hysteresis, leases/screen/input demand and owner mask retained.
   Natural CPU3→2→1 parking reaches CPU0/owner0xe; owner-only1→2→3 restoration
   and actual PlaybackNormal demand restore all cores. Three hotplug cycles
   verify CPU1/2/3 physical bits0x800/0x400/0x200 in both copies.
5. **C3 software.** Every preflight predicate is exposed: system_running,
   boot_policy, spm, local_events, cirq, topology, frequency, screen_off,
   workload, runtime_budget, qualification_backstop, linux_context,
   timer_context, usb_restore, broken, clocks, display_clocks and bus;
   secondary_power and domains are decoded separately. The actual entry also
   checks CPU0 identity, future deadline/GPT4 arm, serialization, resume-vector
   readback, runtime PCM and finisher's actual Linux context buffer. Baseline
   failures were topology/frequency/domains/clocks; display/shared/audio/USB0
   and inherited PERI/INFRA owners are corrected by their real lifecycles.
   Powered DISP is permitted only by exact stock clock quiescence; other
   domains and physical secondary-off masks remain strict. Active unknown
   devices remain blockers. Runtime480-word DPIDLE PCM is retained, not SODI
   or597-word system suspend; normal28-word PCM restored/read back. Exact
   CIRQ155 interrupt mapping/clone/enable/replay/disable is verified. Linux
   GPT4 owns the13MHz one-shot deadline,≥26000ticks, checked at admission and
   finisher. OPP is exactly598000/747500; active1300000 remains available.
   cpu_suspend/cpu_resume supplies MMU/CP15/general/VFP/GIC context; A7
   coherency/L2-retention/MCU_BIU/local timer state are saved and checked.
   Restore faults quarantine C3; bounded qualification uses retained stages
   and10-second RGU backstop, with no unlimited-runtime journal overhead.
6. **C3 physical state: SOFTWARE_READY_NEEDS_NEW_FLASH.** No hardware limit
   is inferred. No C3 entry is claimed from a software test. Default remains
   off; the one-shot/20-cycle harness uses normal experimental runtime controls.
7. **Timer regression.** GPT6/GPT4/PPI29/13MHz/highres/NO_HZ baseline evidence,
   pinned per-core1ms wake and MONOTONIC/RAW continuity pass. Native deadline
   boundaries,64-bit conversion, timer compare/control/CNTFRQ faults, aborted
   context and fallback pass. Actual post-dormant continuity awaits owner flash.
8. **DVFS regression.** All five OPPs598/747.5/1040/1196/1300MHz physically
   reached;1.15/1.15/1.15/1.20/1.25V readbacks pass, faultN/PWRAPerrors0.
   Schedutil/QoS/thermal/voltage order/ceiling preserved. Harness repeats all
   five before and after C3.
9. **Storage regression.** eMMC plus inserted SD each pass eight fsynced,
   uncached checksums per radio-off run; request/DMA/FIFO/controller drain,
   retained-context/runtime resume/gate and media access pass; mismatch/error0,
   mounted ext4 errors0. Candidate retains reviewed high-speed MMC transport.
   SD-absent is unobserved; no live media reset/removal was synthesized.
10. **Tests.** Fresh qualification numbers and artifact receipts above; CPU,
    timer, idle, clock, coordinator, hotplug, suspend-related, MMC/USB,
    thermal/DVFS and existing tests pass. All native prerequisites completed.
    Candidate package/root/preservation/fallback checks pass. The new host
    harness was also run against the actual old baseline: receipt25 refuses
    all mismatched identities before mutation, without starting C3 or radios.
11. **Research.** Exact pinned MT6582 Google/independent BSPs, retained Y2
    source/disassembly/PCM, Linuxv6.18 and Cortex-A7 TRM. Full primary URLs,
    function/register relevance, confidence and explicit inference are in
    the source ledger above and CPU-FINAL-SOURCES. Narrow downloads retain SHA256.
12. **Files changed.** Exact lists follow. Preexisting owner edits in six
    documentation files remain unstaged; they are not included as this pass's
    modifications or in the built source archive.
13. **Local commits.** Linux implementation/fault/harness commits below;
    Rebornb71b468 adds owned DRM screen sleep/wake. A following documentation
    receipt commit records the final seal; it changes no compiled source.
    Git identity and authenticated GitHub account remain unchanged; no push.
14. **Candidate path.** `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/y2linux-cpu-idle-completion-candidate/`.
15. **BOOTIMG SHA256.** `3303cad8d0b73a78653f58d80ede2d1583ed7ef89a48f781f8aaf1669240092d`.
16. **Y2ROOT SHA256.** `816b9a271633c96fd937fa71ef1ac1f93e74436fbd8e97c9d0491470cc4babbb`.
17. **Exact next owner action.** Install BOOTIMG+ANDROID through the included
    preserving scatter/Download Only, retaining Y2DATA and all protected
    partitions. Boot with existing USB SSH and stopped playback, then run the
    single command below. It records one first entry and stops C3 on failure;
    only successful repeated qualification enables ordinary runtime C3.

```sh
cd /home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux
python3 tools/development/qualify-cpu-idle-completion.py \
  --run --enable-qualified-runtime \
  --package out/y2linux-cpu-idle-completion-candidate \
  --ssh-config out/cpu-final-fix02-physical-qualification/20260929T152328Z/ssh-config \
  --host y2 --wifi-host y2-owner-wifi
```

The package's CPU-IDLE-OWNER-HANDOFF.md contains the same owner action and
fallback. Electrical battery life, SD absence and physical external-peer/input
edge behavior are not claimed. Full-system suspend's separate failure and
unrelated release acceptance gates remain open.
