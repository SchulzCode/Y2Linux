# Reborn Product UI v2 candidate receipt

<!-- knowledge-base-scope: scoped-validation-record -->
> **Software receipt, 2026-10-01.** Built and software-validated. **Not
> flashed, not physically qualified.** The [Fix02 physical report](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX02-PHYSICAL-QUALIFICATION.md)
> remains the latest observed hardware state; the [Fix03 receipt](Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX03.md)
> remains the CPU platform change set this candidate is built on.

This candidate is the CPU Final Fix03 platform with the Reborn Product UI v2
pass ([product UI](../../../Y2Reborn/docs/ui/REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V2.md),
[navigation](../../../Y2Reborn/docs/ui/REBORN-PRODUCT-NAVIGATION-V2.md),
[platform boundary](../../../Y2Reborn/docs/architecture/platform-api-boundary.md),
[pass record](../../../Y2Reborn/docs/review/REBORN-PRODUCT-PASS-V2.md)).

## Platform changes in this candidate

| Change | Source | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Early splash shows the Reborn mark | `tools/graphics/reborn-splash.c`, `reborn-splash-mark.h`, `make-splash-mark.py` | The mark is generated from Reborn's own boot frame; a test proves the splash frame and Reborn's hand-off frame are pixel-identical. Only the gold rule breathes while startup continues. Console policy, handoff protocol, charger/voltage gate and 60 s failure timeout unchanged. |
| Backlight off before power-down | `tools/platform/y2_platform/power.py` | After stopping or killing Reborn and before `busybox poweroff/reboot`, every backlight's `bl_power` is set to 4. A crashed or hung Reborn can no longer leave the fbdev-restored buffer lit. |
| Release identity | `tools/production/release.json` | Release `1.0.0-reborn-product-ui-v2-candidate.1`, root `2025.02.18-platform-v1.10`, build `Y2LINUX-REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V2`. |

The kernel, its configuration and modules are the Fix03 source: the built
`zImage` and `display.ko` are byte-identical to Fix03's. In the initramfs
only `sbin/reborn-splash` changed intentionally. `sbin/blkid` differs
because Buildroot overwrites the build-time RPATH with `X` filler of the
build directory's length (a different worktree path). Symbols, versions and
behaviour are identical. The device tree differs only in
`/chosen/linux,initrd-end`.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Linux built source | `5cfe04cb2fe9e1177df99f3113b7a17ee7d442f5` |
| Reborn built source | `bd8436dd2afcdbe4a45b9140aa98e4d20307482b` (0.2.0) |
| Kernel | `6.18.0-y2linux-cpu-final-fix03` (unchanged) |
| Root / release / build | `2025.02.18-platform-v1.10` / `1.0.0-reborn-product-ui-v2-candidate.1` / `Y2LINUX-REBORN-PRODUCT-UI-V2` |
| Fallback | Exact Hardware02 pair (`6.18.0-y2linux-hardware-02`, `2025.02.18-platform-v1.4`) |

## Fresh validation

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Reborn `cargo fmt --check`, `clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -D warnings` | PASS |
| Reborn `cargo test --workspace --locked` | PASS, 211 tests (incl. architecture guard) |
| Production/platform regression (`tools/production/tests.sh`, container) | PASS, 268 tests, 3 explicit native-dependency skips |
| Native host-dependency tests (`test_system_update_fallback`) | PASS |
| Splash protocol, pixels and hand-off identity (`test_reborn_splash`) | PASS, 10 tests |
| Reborn ARM QEMU check, installed ARM modules | PASS |
| ELF dependency closure, no build RPATH | PASS |
| Release inventory, legal-info | PASS |
| Preserving package (`system_update.py`) | PASS: clean ext4, BOOTIMG/Y2ROOT only, no Y2DATA payload, exact Hardware02 fallback |

A first build from Reborn `94e79d8` was superseded before sealing by a
wording fix (two empty states) and documentation; its logs are kept in
`out/reborn-product-ui-v2/superseded-94e79d8/`.

## Candidate

`out/y2linux-reborn-product-ui-v2-candidate/` — `MT6582_preserve_data_scatter.txt`
selects only **BOOTIMG** and **ANDROID/Y2ROOT**. No Y2DATA/USRDATA, preloader,
LK, NVRAM, PROTECT, calibration or factory payload. Nothing was flashed or
pushed.

| File | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `BOOTIMG.img` | `8a974cb5dc672dd0f2a6589a3b8da08a7225879ee7c60e929ed398bbd293e7bf` |
| `Y2ROOT.img` | `a5c2914ed688ff1bc5eecad276a071d084995b47c1ad8c2b1de21182e79f474c` |

## What the owner should look at on the device

1. Power-on: stock LK logo, then the Reborn mark on a dark background with a
   slowly breathing gold rule, no console text, no white frame, then a short
   dissolve into Home.
2. The wheel: one detent moves exactly one row in Settings and short lists;
   only a sustained spin in a long library list moves faster.
3. Hold Power → Quick Settings → Power Off → Power Off: UI fades, the mark
   shows, the screen goes black and dark, then the device turns off with no
   white or console frame.
4. Settings → System → Diagnostics holds every technical detail previously
   on normal screens.

The Fix03 CPU qualification plan (`qualify-cpu-fix03.py`) is unaffected and
can run on this candidate. A first boot of the new splash after flashing is
the only way to measure splash-visible, Reborn first-frame and ready times.
