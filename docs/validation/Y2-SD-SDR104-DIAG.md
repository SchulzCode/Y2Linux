## Evidence from the installed candidate 2

| Test | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 128 MiB direct read right after boot, SDR104 | 1.67 s (~77 MB/s), no errors |
| First 1 GiB direct read | 2 CRC events, 0 timeouts, then `SDR104 -> DDR50 (crc)` |
| Status after the fallback | `tuning_runs=4`, `fallbacks=1`, `resets=1`, `tune_pad` changed from `0x9951500` to `0xa951500` |

The interface works at 200 MHz, but not for a sustained load. It is not proof
that SDR104 is impossible. A clean 128 MiB read is not a qualification.

## What the old SD tuning really did

Decoding `tune_pad` with the MT6582 `MSDC_PAD_TUNE` layout (below):

| Field | `0x9951500` | After the retune `0xa951500` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATRRDLY` | 21 | 21 |
| `CMDRDLY` | 21 | 21 |
| `CMDRRDLY` | 6 | 10 |
| `CLKTXDLY` | 1 | 1 |

Two defects explain these numbers.

1. **A 64-step sweep on a 32-tap delay line.** Mainline `mtk-sd.c` chooses
   `tuning_step` from `MMC_CAP2_NO_MMC`: 64 for a host that cannot do MMC. The
   Y2 SD host declares `no-mmc`, so it swept 64 steps. MT6582 delay fields are
   5 bits wide. Steps 32 to 63 re-tested tap 31, and the "second half"
   registers mainline writes at `PAD_TUNE + 4` are `MSDC_DAT_RDDLY0` on this
   controller (offset `0xf0`), not a second tuning register.
2. **No failing tap.** `get_best_delay()` returns `len / 3` for a window that
   starts at tap 0. For an all-pass 64-step map that is 64 / 3 = **21**, which
   is exactly what both command and data picked, in two independent tunings.
   Neither sweep saw a failing tap, so "21" was arbitrary and said nothing
   about the timing eye.

The `CMDRRDLY` / `CLKTXDLY` values come from the same bug. `sdr_set_field()`
does not mask its value, so the internal-delay sweep at step 38 wrote
`38 << 22`: the low five bits landed in `CMDRRDLY` (6) and bit 5 set bit 27,
`CLKTXDLY` (1). The retune picked 42 and produced 10 and 1. The card clock
output delay was therefore shifted by one tap as a side effect.

This is a hypothesis about timing margin, not a measured eye. The decoded
registers and the arithmetic fit it. The pass maps added by candidate 3 settle
it.

## MT6582 MSDC register facts

Sources: the MediaTek MT6582 BSP `mt6582/sd.c` (register dump and the
`msdc_tune_*` functions), and the stock Y2 kernel functions
`msdc_set_sr`, `msdc_set_smt`, `msdc_set_rdtdsel`, `msdc_set_driving`,
`msdc_pin_pud`, disassembled from the retained stock kernel.

| Item | Fact |
| --- | --- |
| `MSDC_PAD_TUNE` (0xec) | `DATWRDLY[4:0]`, `DATRRDLY[12:8]`, `CMDRDLY[20:16]`, `CMDRRDLY[26:22]`, `CLKTXDLY[31:27]`. Five bits each: 32 taps, linear |
| `MSDC_DAT_RDDLY0/1` (0xf0/0xf4) | Per-lane read delay. Used only when `IOCON.DDLSEL = 1`; mainline runs `DDLSEL = 0` |
| `SDC_DATCRC_STS` (0x60) | Failing data lanes: bits 7:0 rising edge, 15:8 falling edge. Per-lane CRC identification **is** available |
| `MAIN_VER` / `ECO_VER` (0x100/0x104) | Controller version registers |
| Stock UHS tuning (above 100 MHz) | Sweeps `IOCON.RSPL`, `PAD_TUNE.CMDRDLY`, `PATCH_BIT1.CMD_RSP`, `PATCH_BIT0.INT_DAT_LATCH_CK_SEL`, `IOCON.DSPL`, per-lane `DAT_RDDLY`, `PATCH_BIT0.CKGEN_MSDC_DLY_SEL`; error-driven, not a single sweep |
| MSDC1 pad cells (GPIO `0x10005000`) | CLK `0xc40`, CMD `0xc50`, DAT `0xc60`, PAD `0xc70` |
| Pad cell bits | Drive `[10:8]`, slew `[12]`, Schmitt `[13]`; PAD cell: `RDSEL[9:4]`, `TDSEL[3:0]`. Stock uses RDSEL = TDSEL = 0 at both voltages |
| **RXDLYSEL** | The vendor driver never touches `PAD_TUNE` bits 13, 15 or 21 and its `saved_para.pad_tune` is built from the three delay fields only. Mainline sets bit 15 for compatibles without `data_tune`; the status read it back as 0 on both hosts. Candidate 3 settles this on the hardware (see below) |
| SDR104 clock | The MSDC source is `MSDCPLL / 2 = 200 MHz`. Dividers give 100 and 50 MHz; there is no reachable clock between 100 and 200 MHz without retuning a PLL, so there is no "slightly lower SDR104" |

The stock autok code (`msdc_autok_*`) is the SDIO 3.0 calibration of the
WiFi host (it scans over core voltage). It is not a model for the SD slot.

## What candidate 3 changes

No electrical setting changes: voltage, pad drive and the clock source are
exactly candidate 2's.

| Area | Change |
| --- | --- |
| Tuning geometry | The Y2 hosts use exactly 32 taps. SD tuning writes only its own field per sweep (no `DAT_RDDLY0` write, no overflow into `CLKTXDLY`) |
| SD tuning | Scans **both** sampling edges for command and data, and requires **every one of 3 tries** of a tap to pass. Selection: widest eye over both edges, then the better margin, then the rising edge; the centre of that window. Eyes below 4 taps fail the level and the ladder steps down. An all-pass sweep is flagged `open` (no information). The command-internal delay (`CMDRRDLY`) is swept and recorded but applied only when it shows a real eye |
| Failed tuning | The registers it disturbed are restored before the lower level negotiates |
| Diagnostics | New `y2_storage_diag` and `y2_tune_diag`. `y2_storage` keeps its one-line contract |
| Characterization | Root-only `y2_lab` on the SD host, compiled in only while `Y2_MSDC_LAB` is 1 |
| eMMC | Functionally unchanged. It keeps the mainline tuning; only passive records are added |

Windows are linear: `Y2_TUNE_CIRCULAR` is 0 because tap 31 is not adjacent to
tap 0 on this delay line. The helper supports a circular line and is tested
for it.

## Diagnostics reference

Both attributes live under `/sys/bus/platform/devices/11240000.mmc/` (SD) and
`11230000.mmc` (eMMC, `y2_storage_diag` only). Every line is `key=value` or
`key: field=value ...`.

`y2_storage_diag`:

| Line | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `host= mode= timing= level= ceiling= width= clock_hz= actual_hz= cap_hz=` | Negotiated state |
| `signal:` | Signalling voltage from `ios`, from the driver state and the regulator (`vqmmc_mv`, enabled, `vmmc_mv`) |
| `card:` | Name, manufacturer, revisions, `sd3_bus_mode`, driver types, `uhs_max_dtr` |
| `fallback:` | Previous mode, current mode, **reason**, counts, resets, retunes, tuning runs at the fallback |
| `regs:` / `regs.tune:` | `IOCON`, `PAD_TUNE`, `DAT_RDDLY0/1`, `PATCH_BIT0/1/2`, `MSDC_CFG`, `SDC_CFG`, `PS`, decoded delays and edges |
| `probe:` / `rxdlysel:` | Which `PAD_TUNE` / `DAT_RDDLY` bits stick when written (write ones, read, clear), controller versions, and `supported` / `requested` / `actual` for RXDLYSEL |
| `pad:` / `pad.clk,cmd,dat,pad:` | Raw pad cells read back from the GPIO block, with drive, slew, Schmitt, pull byte, requested drive, RDSEL, TDSEL |
| `pad.drive:` | Drive values before programming and the error code |
| `fault.total=` ... | Counters: `cmd_crc`, `cmd_timeout`, `data_crc`, `data_timeout`, `stop`, `other`, `timeouts` |
| `fault.lanes:` | Failing data lanes (rising and falling edge) |
| `fault.first:` / `fault.last:` | Sequence, time, kind, command, direction, block size and count, argument, controller error bits, `DATCRC_STS`, level, timing, `PAD_TUNE`, `IOCON`, `PATCH_BIT0` |

`y2_tune_diag`: for the first and the latest tuning, the registers at the end
of the sweep, then per phase (`cmd`, `cmd_int`, `data`) the pick (edge, delay,
window, eye width, margins, `open`, clipping, window counts, what the old
`get_best_delay` would have chosen) and, per scanned edge, the `all` map (every
try passed), the `any` map (at least one try passed) and the passing windows.
Bit `n` of a map is tap `n`.

Only the first failure of a boot is logged (`Y2 storage first fault:`). Later
failures are counted without logging.

## Characterization interface (`y2_lab`)

Root-only (0600) on the SD host. Unmount the card first: a marginal operating
point can fail reads.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `set name=value ...` | Writes one field: `cmdrdly cmdrrdly datrrdly datwrdly clktxdly rspl dspl wdspl ddlsel latchck ckgen wrcrcs cmdta rddly0 rddly1`, or a pad `drv_clk drv_cmd drv_dat` (0 to 7), `sr_clk sr_cmd sr_dat` (0 or 1) |
| `scan [tries=N] [latchck=L] [ckgen=C]` | Sweeps every tap, both edges, command and data at the given `PATCH_BIT0` fields; restores the registers; reading `y2_lab` returns the maps and windows |
| `retune` | Runs the production SD tuning again |
| `level NAME` | Renegotiates at a ladder level (e.g. back to `SDR104` after a fallback) |

## Planned characterization (after the owner flashes candidate 3)

1. Capture identity, card, mode, clock, voltage, tuning maps, edges, drive
   readback and counters.
2. Reproduce the workload: 128 MiB, then 1 GiB, then repeated multi-GiB direct
   reads of the raw device, hashed for integrity.
3. Use the evidence to pick the dimension: a thin or open eye, command or data
   CRC only, drive not sticking, an invalid RXDLYSEL assumption, or good
   windows with sustained errors (thermal, voltage, signal integrity).
4. Implement the correction the evidence supports, then qualify with repeated
   multi-GiB reads, runtime suspend and resume, idle and wake, repeated mode
   setup and reboot negotiation, with zero CRC, timeouts, resets and fallbacks.

## Tests

`tests/test_sd_tuning.py` (20 tests): window detection, wrap-around on a
circular line only, midpoint and margins, the open eye, multiple windows,
narrow-eye rejection, edge selection, command and data CRC classification,
fault log first/last and lane histogram, pad cell decoding, pad readback and
set through the real `pinctrl.c` code, RXDLYSEL, a simulated controller that
runs the real tuning code (separate command and data picks, flaky taps,
failure with register restore, open eye), the diagnostic output and its one-page
budget, and fallback cause. `tests/test_storage_ceiling.py` keeps its
contracts. Both run in `tools/production/tests.sh`.
