# No-SD console photo

Owner confirms USB connected, SD absent, and supplies a photo of Linux fbcon.
Visible uptime is approximately 154–156 seconds. Repeated lines identify
`mtk-msdc 11240000.mmc`, `msdc_track_cmd_data`, CMD55 with argument 0,
CMD8 with argument 0x1aa, and `host->error=0x00000002`.

Source interpretation: kernel/dts/innioasis-y2-first-boot.dts maps 11240000
 to the removable SD host; 11230000 is internal eMMC. SD uses `broken-cd`,
which upstream drivers/mmc/core/host.c maps to MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL. The MMC
rescan worker retries while no card responds. Upstream mtk-sd.c defines bit 1
as REQ_CMD_TMO and prints each failed command with dev_warn. Production inherits
loglevel=8 plus ignore_loglevel, exposing all those expected empty-slot timeouts.

This establishes a running Linux console/display without SD and an empty-slot
logging defect. It does not establish internal root/data mounts or explain the
absent Linux USB gadget. The photo does not show an internal-eMMC failure,
root handover result, kernel panic or the observer USB status rows.
No code change or physical write is justified solely as a cure for USB from this
photo. A temporary card insertion without reboot can test whether warning traffic
stops; production neither automounts the card nor accepts it as root.
