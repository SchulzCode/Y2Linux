# Production Storage / Installation v1 partition audit

Current correction: [stock Y2 eMMC address compatibility](../knowledge/storage06-addressing-correction.md).
Storage05's physical boot failed, but the corrected owner readback at21:10:43 CEST
proves intact MBR/EBRs and exact flashed ext4 identity prefixes. The actual stock
FM kernel adds23552 native user sectors and exposes15203328 sectors; the port
omitted that mapping. Stock geometry/classification below remains unchanged.
Upstream Linux6.18 parses these tables without a compatibility parser. Corrected
physical internal-root acceptance remains pending.
BOOTIMG now owns loadable modules; rootfs/data and module ownership follow the
[update contract](update-model.md). No physical success is inferred from builds.


Current correction: the first manual attempt completed BOOTIMG transfer but
failed3154 on ANDROID. Selected DA[5] rejects sparse FILL. Storage02 uses raw
ext4 transport. DA physical user capacity is7818182656bytes (15269888sectors);
the historical Android exported disk remains7784103936bytes (15203328sectors).
The difference is outside layoutv1 allocation, never reclaimed. See the
[retained failure proof](../hardware-evidence/2026-09-13-storage-flash-failure/README.md).
Partition boundaries and classification below remain unchanged.

2026-09-13, baseline `1583360`. All 21 stock scatter entries reviewed before
implementation. Sources: [reconciled physical Android map](../knowledge/partition-map.tsv),
[map interpretation](../knowledge/partition-map.md), [LK/boot contract](../knowledge/boot-chain.md),
[recovery material](../knowledge/handoff-artifacts.tsv), [native MSDC identity](../knowledge/m2-baseline-hardware-result.md),
[donor/address research](../knowledge/reverse-engineering-audit.md), and local
owner-proven FM scatter. No source or ROM-wide rehash was repeated. Only the
scatter, overwritten-partition stock sources and table bytes are checked for this package.
Current Linux disables eMMC; initial SSH timed out; owner then connected Y2 and read-only SSH succeeded. Native CID/CSD evidence
and stock runtime metadata remain the latest available evidence, not live native
filesystem proof. 48 kHz remains unqualified; M3 is not closed.

All normal starts below are **stock logical disk bytes**, matching the scatter's
`physical_start_addr` field. Native EMMC_USER commands add0xb80000 (23552 sectors).
Legacy global DA coordinates instead add0x1400000. The full JSON preserves the
original scatter fields; current packages also carry explicit
`storage_addressing` and corrected readback coordinates. PRELOADER (EMMC_BOOT_1)
and BMTPOOL (sentinel) are separate: the vendor20MiB PRELOADER span is not a
hardware boot-region extent (each boot region is4MiB).

| Stock entry | Classification | Stock logical/scatter start | Stock span | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PRELOADER | KEEP | `0x0` | `0x1400000` | Boot ROM handoff; special hardware region span unresolved |
| MBR | KEEP | `0x0` | `0x80000` | Stock partition table |
| EBR1 | KEEP | `0x80000` | `0x80000` | Stock extended partition table |
| PRO_INFO | KEEP | `0x100000` | `0x300000` | Device/product identity; exact contents private/unknown |
| NVRAM | KEEP | `0x400000` | `0x500000` | Device-specific calibration and identity |
| PROTECT_F | KEEP | `0x900000` | `0xa00000` | Protected device data |
| PROTECT_S | KEEP | `0x1300000` | `0xa00000` | Protected device data |
| SECCFG | KEEP | `0x1d00000` | `0x20000` | Security configuration |
| UBOOT | KEEP | `0x1d20000` | `0x60000` | Stock LK bootloader |
| BOOTIMG | REUSE | `0x1d80000` | `0x1000000` | Linux kernel + DT + rescue |
| RECOVERY | KEEP | `0x2d80000` | `0x1000000` | Independent stock recovery route |
| SEC_RO | KEEP | `0x3d80000` | `0x600000` | Security/radio configuration |
| MISC | KEEP | `0x4380000` | `0x80000` | Boot/recovery control state |
| LOGO | KEEP | `0x4400000` | `0x300000` | LK display resource |
| EBR2 | KEEP | `0x4700000` | `0x80000` | Stock extended partition table |
| EXPDB | LEGACY | `0x4780000` | `0xa00000` | Legacy crash records; no reclamation without dependency review |
| ANDROID | REUSE | `0x5180000` | `0x33400000` | Y2ROOT ext4; stock /system |
| CACHE | LEGACY | `0x38580000` | `0x7e00000` | Unused Android cache; potential later staging, left untouched |
| USRDATA | REUSE | `0x40380000` | `0x32000000` | Y2DATA ext4; stock /data, destructive first initialization |
| FAT | LEGACY | `0x72380000` | `0x0` | Legacy internal shared/media storage; may contain user files, leave untouched |
| BMTPOOL | UNKNOWN | `0xffff00a8` | `0x1500000` | Vendor sentinel/unaligned special region: DO NOT TOUCH |

FAT's zero scatter length is dynamic: stock runtime resolves 0x15dc00000 bytes
from 0x72380000, ending at 0x1cff80000. The historical Android exported bound is 0x1cff80000; DIAG01 confirms native
physical capacity 0x1d2000000 (15269888 sectors).
BMTPOOL has no approved operational range. EBR1's vendor allocation is 512 KiB,
but Linux's stock p1 view is only 1024 bytes; preserve both facts.

## Reuse decision and dependencies

| Component | Stock name / current purpose | Stock logical / global linear start | Partition bytes | Linux stock view | SPFT |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BOOTIMG | BOOTIMG, current M3 Linux boot | 0x1d80000 / 0x3180000 | 16777216 | Whole user disk range; no stock node | Independent NORMAL_ROM row |
| Y2ROOT | ANDROID, stock ext4 /system | 0x5180000 / 0x6580000 | 859832320 (820 MiB) | p5, start 166912 sectors, length 1679360 sectors | Independent YAFFS_IMG row; Storage02 raw ext4 transport |
| Y2DATA | USRDATA, stock ext4 /data | 0x40380000 / 0x41780000 | 838860800 (800 MiB) | p7, start 2104320 sectors, length 1638400 sectors | Independent YAFFS_IMG row; Storage02 raw ext4 transport |

LK reads BOOTIMG's legacy Android/MediaTek envelopes and transfers its ramdisk;
it does not need Android /system or /data to run Linux. Preloader loads stock LK
and retains the stock partition contract. No table, LK, preloader, recovery or
security mutation is required. Stock recovery still expects Android filesystems:
never use its wipe/update menus on Y2Linux. Restoring Android requires the verified
FM boot/system/userdata images (factory state, not original personal Android data).
Original installed Android data is not backed up; take a private USRDATA readback
before first install if its personal state must be recoverable. Preserve FAT/media.

Native Linux must check host11230000, nonremovable MMC type, disk capacity and
partition start/size before accepting LABEL=Y2ROOT/Y2DATA. Labels alone are not
write authorization. No fixed mmcblk number or vendor /emmc alias is assumed.
Both native filesystem mounts are **implemented candidate behavior, not yet
physically qualified**. Resolver failure leaves ACM rescue active.

CACHE (126 MiB) cannot hold the current 512 MiB root image. FAT is large but dynamic
and may hold user media; it is unnecessary for v1. ANDROID is sufficient and
preserves the stock tables. USRDATA provides independent persistent storage now.
A/B BOOTIMG is not cheaply available without taking RECOVERY or changing LK's
selection contract. Prefer staged single-slot updates from rescue; reserve no new
partitions. Y2DATA can stage compact current system/app payloads; future updater
must check free space and expanded size, and permit host-assisted recovery if a
larger image cannot be staged. No promise of automatic rollback after torn BOOTIMG.

## Native write policy review

Production MSDC remains at legacy one-bit/13MHz with inherited LK pinmux and rails.
The v6.18 MMC core needs EXT_CSD WRITE_BYTE using command-set1 (see locked
`include/linux/mmc/mmc.h` and `drivers/mmc/core/mmc_ops.c`), including volatile
ERASE_GROUP_DEF initialization that the historical identity-only kernel rejected.
Storage03 permits explicitly reviewed volatile EXT_CSD controls and read/identity
commands, validated bounded CMD23 companions and idempotent unchanged user-area
selection. It refuses boot-configuration changes, other hardware partition
selection, erase/trim/sanitize, RPMB/vendor operations and firmware writes. Only
sector-addressed cards of the observed capacity in EMMC_USER may issue writes;
the complete request must fit ANDROID or USRDATA. Boot-area enumeration is disabled
and production uses serialized requests. See the [correction rationale](../knowledge/storage03-corrections.md).
All other stock partitions remain outside the write allowlist, including BOOTIMG;
future rescue OTA must deliberately extend the guard for that component. This is
accident containment, not a security boundary against a replaceable kernel.
