# Bluetooth platform v1 contract

<!-- knowledge-base-scope: source-contract; baseline02-sync 2026-10-03 -->

## Current Baseline02 source and qualification scope

CONSYS/HCI, BlueZ 5.87 and BlueALSA 5.0.0 remain radio/transport/encoder owners;
Reborn retains decode/DSP and final conversion. Calibration, bonds and owner data
stay private. `y2-bt-reconnect` remains the sole automatic connection owner.
Requested preference, mutual availability, negotiated PCM and qualification
remain separate; observation does not activate a radio or certify a peer.

The current owner-private integration profile builds and enables optional
AAC/aptX/aptX-HD/LDAC endpoints through validated codec policy. SBC remains the
baseline. Quality defaults are SBC high, LDAC standard and requested LDAC ABR;
private SBC xq/xq+ controls are available. Compiled library, configured quality
and requested ABR do not prove active negotiated output or adaptation. The
public/SBC-only and earlier optional-disabled experiment profiles are separate
configurations; neither is the current private Baseline02 default.

Private integration does not grant public redistribution or qualified Auto
promotion. Earlier bounded owner-confirmed SBC peer playback remains its named
receipt. The UART01 CPU-idle campaign uses a Wi-Fi observer with radios off for
C3 entry; it does not qualify optional Bluetooth peer/CPU/coexistence/endurance.
Baseline02's new-image/cold-boot tests are pending. Current source/API references:
[codec inventory](../../tools/platform/codec_manifest.py),
[quality controls](../../tools/platform/y2_platform/codec_controls.py),

## Historical source contract and physical notes

The retained description below belongs to earlier profiles/source cuts.
Optional-disabled, XQ-unsupported and preference-UI-deferred statements below are
historical. Use the current source/feature inventory for active policy; retain
the earlier ownership/lifecycle and evidence records for traceability.

# Bluetooth platform v1 contract

**2026-09-28 source/physical scope:** The candidate's private experiment
profile compiles optional encoder libraries, but normal BlueALSA service starts
with optional endpoints disabled and SBC as the baseline. The earlier source
review's "no ARM proof/source integration" wording below applies to the
pre-campaign configuration and is superseded by the
[Hardware Final codec source work](../validation/Y2-HARDWARE-FINAL-RADIO-AUDIO.md).
Fix01 physically proves a bounded isolated CONSYS retry, not headset audio or
Auto qualification. [Current state](../CURRENT_PLATFORM_STATE.md).

CONSYS/HCI, BlueZ 5.87 and BlueALSA 5.0.0 remain the control/transport/encoder
owners. Reborn retains FFmpeg decode/DSP and one final conversion. Pairing trust,
Rate/Format observation and transport generation invalidation were already fixed
by later Reborn source; the older codec audit does not supersede those fixes.

`y2-bt-observe` makes bounded, read-only native GIO D-Bus queries. It never activates
a radio or opens/selects a transport. It addresses unique daemon owners and checks
owners again before publishing; owner replacement invalidates the sample.
`y2-status bluetooth` normalizes adapter, paired/trusted/connected peer, manager
runtime codecs, exact negotiated codec and PCM Format/Rate/Channels. S24_LE means
24 valid bits in a 32-bit container. Selected/requested preferences are separate
from observation. Unsupported or incomplete PCM is degraded, never assumed S16.

BlueALSA GetCodecs reports a subset filtered by local enabled endpoints and
remote capabilities. It is labelled mutually_usable; raw remote_advertised remains
null. Neither live encoder bitrate nor radio packet loss is fabricated. PCM
connection Sequence, object and owner are exposed; clients opening PCM must also
consume ObjectManager removal and owner signals for per-open lifetime, as Reborn
already does. A snapshot cannot prove no removal occurred between snapshots.

The image's codec inventory is generated from the configured, built BlueALSA
source, with pinned source/configuration hashes. It fails packaging on an
unexpected optional encoder. Build, runtime, remote/mutual, distribution and
qualification states are separate. Current normal runtime starts conformant SBC
high quality only; XQ remains unsupported. The owner-private experiment profile
also compiles optional encoders, with their endpoints disabled at normal start.
No optional peer codec is physically qualified for Fix01. Production Auto must
not promote an unqualified codec.

Reborn exports /org/reborn/player and registers it with BlueZ Media1. A bounded
eight-command queue accepts calls from the current BlueZ unique owner only.
Play/Pause resolve idempotently against the current AppModel; Next/Previous and
PlayPause use existing Actions. Playback status and bounded metadata are a
projection of that model, not another player authority. PropertiesChanged reports
actual model changes; requesting Pause does not claim playback has already paused.
The registration is recreated when the BlueZ owner changes. No volume or gain
policy is introduced. Physical AVRCP and peer interoperability remain PHYSICAL_GATE.

API basis: pinned BlueALSA 5.0.0 docs/org.bluealsa.PCM1.7.rst and
src/bluealsa-dbus.c (GetCodecs filtering); pinned BlueZ 5.87 profiles/audio/media.c;
[BlueZ Media API](https://github.com/bluez/bluez/blob/master/doc/org.bluez.Media.rst).
Optional codec provenance/distribution and Auto/reconnect implementation are
tracked separately in the completion ledger; an audit is not a release approval.

Automatic Device connection remains solely owned by y2-bt-reconnect. One episode
allows at most two 10-second calls within a 25-second start window; successful
connected observation for 30 seconds resets a later link-loss episode. Same-boot
budget, explicit disconnect inhibition and unknown outstanding calls survive
helper restart. A local/client timeout inhibits further automatic requests.
A new explicit connect/power-on intent can re-arm; periodic polling cannot.
Reborn and y2-radio hold a common Linux flock through each user operation.
Pending intents inhibit recovery even if that client dies; only an observed
successful explicit operation re-arms. No pairing is automatic. Runtime records
are private, boot-bound and status rejects stale observations.

Linux lock interoperability is covered by an actual competing file-descriptor
lock test and the pinned Rust implementation's [Unix flock semantics](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html#method.try_lock).
This policy is HOST_VALIDATED; headset disappearance, daemon restart, intentional
disconnect and reconnect after long absence remain owner qualification cases.

`rebornctl bluetooth codec Auto|SBC ADDRESS` implements explicit stopped-playback
codec selection. Auto requires every inventory/runtime/mutual/distribution/physical
gate. Two preferred candidates (LDAC, aptX-HD, aptX, AAC in that fixed order) and
conformant SBC consume at most three attempts, with a 12-second attempt-start
window and bounded D-Bus calls. This is a deterministic initial policy, not a
measured quality ranking. All current Auto candidates are physically unqualified:
the command reports the gate, never silently calls SBC qualified. Manual SBC is
the qualification baseline. No automatic promotion/flapping or Device.Connect
loop is added. SBC XQ, live bitrate and LE Audio remain unsupported.

A shared PCM lifetime lease excludes selection while a Reborn probe/handle exists,
even when paused. Selection checks unique daemon owners, peer connection, PCM
connection sequence/direction and supported stereo 44.1/48 rates. A pending record
precedes mutation; ambiguous completion or app death blocks new PCM opens until
BlueALSA owner replacement. Actual PCM remains separate from requested/selected
codec. The control/API surface is implemented; preference UI is deferred.

Optional encoders in the private experiment profile are not normal-runtime
endpoints or approved public product features. FDK-AAC's
[NOTICE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mstorsjo/fdk-aac/master/NOTICE) grants no
patent license; the [libfreeaptx LGPL source](https://github.com/regularhunter/libfreeaptx)
is a better future linked-library candidate than mixing GPL-3 libopenaptx with
FDK; [AOSP LDAC NOTICE](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libldac/+/2efdd91222c4c5f929335f34cbc3b576343cf1d2/NOTICE)
requests product certification. Public distribution approval is not evidenced.
Their source integration and ARM/QEMU execution are described in the
[later source receipt](../validation/Y2-HARDWARE-FINAL-RADIO-AUDIO.md). Actual
peer audio, CPU/coexistence, Auto promotion and public distribution approval
remain BLOCKED_BY_EVIDENCE. SBC peer qualification is a separate physical gate;
private source builds are not production authorization.
