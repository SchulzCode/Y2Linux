# Owner reset and state export

Software contract; target filesystem/flush/reboot qualification remains
PHYSICAL_GATE. No maintenance command has been run on Y2 during this pass.
Commands operate only on identity-checked Y2DATA. They never format it or touch
protected partitions, NVRAM, firmware calibration or factory records.

`y2-platform export-state` creates a private mode-0600 archive under
`/data/exports`. It includes the atomic Reborn session (settings/queue/position)
and Bluetooth preferred peer, excluding bonds and all private keys. Add
`--include-database` for a consistent SQLite online backup/quick_check; the source
is opened read-only and checked against replacement. Add `--include-network`
only when deliberately exporting private WPA credentials. The manifest records
that privacy choice, source identity, sizes and hashes. Each file and the SQLite
snapshot is coherent; no cross-file transaction is claimed. Download the archive
over authenticated USB SFTP and verify its reported SHA256. Incomplete archives
have a `.partial` name, never a successful export receipt. No automatic import or
untrusted archive extraction is provided.

Reset scopes are separate:

| Scope | Exact behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `settings` | Use defaults emitted by the installed Reborn binary; replace only `model.settings` in session schema 2. Preserve queue, position, library and music. Backup original session first. |
| `network` | Quarantine saved network directory; boot creates disabled/default network configuration. |
| `bluetooth-bonds` | Quarantine BlueZ adapter state and preferred peer. Bind-mount root remains intact; no copied-back bond material. |
| `library` | Quarantine database + WAL/SHM/journal as one recoverable operation; Reborn rebuilds its database. Music stays. |
| `caches` | Quarantine known platform/Reborn cache directories. |
| `full-user` | Explicit logical reset of known Reborn/music/network/settings/apps/legacy-player/cache/log and Bluetooth user state. Requires a second `--erase-user-music` flag. |

Full logical reset preserves owner SSH access, entropy, platform boot/update/
rollback records, existing exports and reset quarantine, factory/calibration,
and unknown data directories. It is **not secure erasure of every old byte** or
an indiscriminate Y2DATA wipe. Existing exports can preserve sensitive owner
state and must be handled separately before handing the device to another owner.

`y2-platform reset plan --scope settings` first reports consumers that must be
stopped. It never stops hardware or deletes files automatically. Stop the listed
init services with a bounded owner command (for example `timeout 10
/etc/init.d/S05reborn stop`) and run plan again. If a process remains in kernel
I/O, execution refuses rather than proceeding. The plan returns exact paths,
identities, preserved state and a five-minute confirmation digest.

```
y2-platform reset plan --scope settings
y2-platform reset execute --confirm DIGEST
# Full user reset requires both the matching full-user plan and:
y2-platform reset execute --confirm DIGEST --erase-user-music
```

Execution rechecks process owners, update state, boot/mount generation and every
target inode before mutation. A durable maintenance marker prevents Reborn,
connectivity, BlueZ and readiness startup while an operation is incomplete. Each
rename into `/data/reset-quarantine/ID` is fsynced and recorded. After interruption,
stop any listed consumers and use `reset resume --confirm DIGEST` (and the full
reset flag if applicable). Resume across a new boot requires the same validated
data UUID, original inode identities and private journal. Conflicting new files
are never overwritten. Keep the marker and inspect the exact source/quarantine
paths if conflicts prevent resume; do not force a reset through uncertainty.
On success the marker is removed; the owner reboots through the platform command
so ordinary initialization recreates missing defaults and service bind mounts.

Quarantine makes reset recoverable but does not free its occupied space. Explicit
`reset purge --id ID --confirm DIGEST` deletes only that completed reset's numeric
payload entries, at most 256 entries/eight seconds per call. Repeat while it says
`MoreRemaining`. It pins directories, rejects submounts, and unlinks symlinks
without following them. The small manifest is retained. No cache cleaner ever
purges this user-state recovery area or removes music automatically.

Tests exercise live WAL backup, credential exclusion, exact settings-only reset,
process/mount/confirmation gates, interrupted multi-file reset across boot,
full-reset preservation and symlink-safe bounded purge. Host tests are separate
from physical eMMC power-loss behavior. All current services still run with
owner/root privilege; this utility narrows paths and state transitions, not the
trusted owner's administrative authority.
