# First BOOTIMG-only experiment: launch readiness

> Current policy: [D11–D13 risk-accepted diagnostic](risk-accepted-diagnostic.md) supersedes the earlier absolute authentication/current-backup/full-handoff gates below. This document retains the historical assessment; watchdog, observation, verified recovery and BOOTIMG-only scope remain mandatory. No flash authorized.

2026-09-08 follow-up, [Y2E-145 / #17](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/17), with [Y2E-140 / #16](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/16). **NO-GO for the first Linux hardware boot.** The owner confirms only ordinary USB/ADB is available, with no additional UART hardware/evidence. Bounded offline analysis and read-only ADB improved the gates but did not pass them. No device mode change, DA execution, partition read/write, security modification, experimental boot or Linux feature change occurred.

The existing UART0 candidate stays byte-identical: BOOTIMG SHA-256 `574061649e10266927267b68afbc95da7fe0761dc9823e88767741bac9363fd9`, build `b4fcc12fc86d025dfa626c671db0eb611bf97943`. All 28 retained bundle members were rehashed successfully. D08 and all kernel/DT/initramfs bytes remain unchanged. Offline validation is not withdrawn; hardware readiness is explicitly rejected for the requested 60-second experiment.

## Observation: ordinary USB is not a verified early console

Fresh `/proc/consoles` still selects ttyMT0 / hardware UART0. The prior native-domain evidence remains 1.8 V, with 921600 8N1 the firmware-supported starting setting. Neither native PCB TX/GND pads nor voltage at an exposed point is confirmed. Further targeted public searches produced no usable Y2-specific pinout. The previously inspected teardown image remains revision-unmatched and unlabelled; no connection can be inferred from pad appearance.

The USB alternative now has **actual FM preloader control-flow evidence**, not only strings:

- `0x0020b584` calls the detector at `0x0021065c`.
- The detector configures PHY registers around `0x11210868`, then reads line-state at `0x11200620`. Comparisons at `0x002106d2` / `0x002106d8` recognize values 0xc0 or 0x80, print the Prolific/FTDI cable message, and return 1; other states take the USB/no-cable path and return 0.
- A nonzero result at `0x0020b588` reaches `0x0020b596`, calling the UART-mode switch at `0x0020b024`, and records a mode flag. A zero result takes `0x0020b5a4`, the “Keep stay in USB Mode” branch.
- The switch includes PHY changes and UART0's routing register at `0x11002090`; its sibling vendor implementation is already pinned in the previous observation capture. These are raw electrical/mux operations, not an Android ADB service or host serial protocol negotiated through the normal USB cable.

Consequently this lead does **not** make the owner's present USB/ADB cable an early serial receiver. Cable wiring/level/detection requirements and persistence through installed LK into Linux are still unknown. Native 1.8 V UART-pad data must not be applied blindly to USB connector pins. No guessed cable, resistor, host voltage or live PHY switch is justified.

Current `sys.usb.config` is `mass_storage,adb`; that reports the running Android gadget. The candidate has no USB controller/gadget or adbd. USB enumeration/disconnect monitoring would indicate only gross activity, not distinguish LK rejection, decompressor failure, kernel panic or PID1 progress. The existing last_kmsg export is a previous stock shutdown tail, not an early serial capture. A RAM-log alternative still needs a proved retained interval, compatible format/reader and reset preservation; none is established, and silently adding it would change the first-artifact architecture. **Y2E-140 remains open.**

## U07b: package secure boot is hardware-dependent

The owner-used FM preloader SHA-256 remains `1df1b62498754aab0c7ddc80a79d310a92fcf81f29b515730c562aaeeb6a884a`; LK is `bb1a93b4c1f02eab09ebad1314a8fdc25d94d3ca99771fc14e21cb18a289964a`.

The preloader contains `AND_ROMINFO_v` at **file offset 0x4fc**, version 2, and `AND_SECCTRL_v` at structure offset 0xd0. Its `m_sec_usb_dl` (+0xe4) and **`m_sec_boot` (+0xe8) are both 0x22**. Structure correspondence is independently supported by pinned MediaTek [sec_rom_info.h](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/drivers/misc/mediatek/masp/mt6582/asf/asf_inc/sec_rom_info.h) and [sec_ctrl.h](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/drivers/misc/mediatek/masp/mt6582/asf/asf_inc/sec_ctrl.h). No key material is published.

Exact LK instructions, rather than enum names from another source version, define the interpretation:

| Input/path | Package LK behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime ROM_INFO +0xe8 = 0x11 | `0x81e20262` returns 1: verification required. |
| +0xe8 = 0x22 or 0 | `0x81e2022e` calls `0x81e27d1c`, which reads **bit 1 of 0x10206060**. A set bit returns the S-CHIP/enabled result; clear returns NS-CHIP/0. Thus 0x22 is **not unconditional disable** in this LK. |
| Other +0xe8 | Invalid configuration/assertion path. |
| Normal security check, software-secure override absent, helper returns 0 | `0x81e207f8` branches to `0x81e209e0`, the no-check path. |
| Helper returns nonzero | BOOTIMG verification/unlock/SEC_RO branches remain relevant; current seccfg state and normal-call arguments matter. |

The policy initializer `0x81e202b8` clears the runtime policy structure and writes zero to +0x10 (software-secure override) at `0x81e202e4` before ROM_INFO discovery. That default is not proof that later code or installed configuration cannot alter it. `0x81e236d4` searches PRELOADER for ROM_INFO; the observed package field is therefore an input candidate, not an installed RAM read.

**Installed conclusion: unsigned-image acceptance remains unproved.** No MMIO/security register was read or changed on the live device. ADB is uid 2000, ro.secure=1, ro.debuggable=0, bootloader/bootmode properties say unknown, and modern verified-boot/lock properties are empty. Android `test-keys`, adbd availability and ro.secure do not report this LK's hardware bit or partition verification policy. No accessible security-state export was established. `/dev/sec` and loader/boot device permissions exclude this shell. The successful owner SPFT operation establishes recovery compatibility, not arbitrary unsigned BOOTIMG acceptance.

Smallest remaining authentication proof: acquire installed loader identity and the selected secure-boot result through an established readback/stock-log route. A matching package loader plus independently observed NS-CHIP/no-check normal path could close this gate. If authentication is enforced, stop and use an owner-authorized supported signing route; do not alter fuses/seccfg, unlock as a workaround, patch verification or use an unsigned trial as the test.

## Current BOOTIMG recovery status

Fresh dumchar metadata agrees with the existing partition map. BOOTIMG occupies **EMMC_USER [0x01d80000,0x02d80000)**, exactly **0x01000000 = 16,777,216 bytes**. Scatter logical 0x03180000 is not the physical EMMC_USER readback address. UBOOT/LK is [0x01d20000,0x01d80000).

`/dev/block/mmcblk0` is root:system 0660, `/dev/bootimg` root:system 0640, and `/dev/uboot` root:root 0600. The ADB shell lacks system/root membership; `test -r /dev/block/mmcblk0` returns remote status 1. No raw read was attempted through those denied interfaces, and no privilege escalation/root restart was used. A package file or local generated boot-stock.img is not a current-device backup. **There is no acquired current BOOTIMG backup or independent backup copy.**

SPFT executable and bundled DA hashes were reverified. `history.ini` still names the FM scatter; authHistory is invalid/empty. `option.ini` points to `/tmp/SP_FT_Logs`, but that directory does not exist. Its Format_All_Download/Firmware_Upgrade/Download_Only flags describe available scenes, not historical selected mode. `CustomScene CheckedItems=9,11` is not a semantic, authenticated record of the prior write targets. The bundled readback XML targets another chip/partitions and is unsuitable as a Y2 recipe. The flasher was not launched.

The [prepared BOOTIMG-only runbook](bootimg-recovery-runbook.md) fixes exact ranges, artifacts, readback checks, restore selection and abort criteria. **Operational gaps:** exact DA/connection sequence from the successful use, actual raw acquisition, independent retention, and verified bounded write/readback semantics. Owner-proven v5.2032 recovery remains accepted; a destructive rehearsal or whole-device reflash is not requested.

## U07c: normal-boot watchdog is an adverse finding

The package LK arms the AP watchdog during platform initialization: direct call `0x81e00338 → 0x81e10e20`. At `0x81e10e7e` it passes **10** to `0x81e10df4`, whose write is `(10 << 11) | 8 = 0x5008` at **0x10007004**. At `0x81e10ea4..0x81e10ea8` it ORs mode bits **0x5d** plus key **0x22000000** into **0x10007000**, then restarts via key **0x1971** at **0x10007008**.

The pinned MediaTek [watchdog implementation](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/drivers/misc/mediatek/wdt/mt6582/mtk_wdt.c) defines the seconds-to-register conversion; [mt_wdt.h](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/arch/arm/mach-mt6582/include/mach/mt_wdt.h) identifies enable, external reset, IRQ and dual-mode bits. This is a **nominal 10-second interval with IRQ/dual-mode behavior**, not a measured claim that the board resets exactly ten seconds after kernel entry. Remaining count, clock tolerance, dual-stage timing and other watchdogs are not measured.

A real disable helper exists at `0x81e10ddc` (clear enable bit 0, keyed write). Its identified direct callers are **Download boot at 0x81e006c8** and **fastboot_init at 0x81e18ad6**. These are not the normal BOOTIMG launch path. The normal final sequence at `0x81e1816c` calls platform cleanup `0x81e00458`, then interrupt/cache/MMU cleanup before kernel entry. The platform cleanup contains LED and GIC cleanup, not that watchdog-disable helper. Nearby 0x7000 register-offset matches were checked: display accesses are at **0x14007000**, not AP_RGU 0x10007000. No normal-handoff AP watchdog disable was established.

**Decision:** Treat an armed watchdog as inherited until installed evidence proves otherwise. Current M1 has no watchdog driver or service. It cannot be approved as a 60-second unattended diagnostic run. Do not silently substitute Download/Fastboot entry, shorten success criteria, or patch the candidate merely to work around an unverified installed handoff. A reviewed minimal watchdog policy may be required once installed normal-path behavior is established; D08 does not need expansion for this research finding.

Other bounded handoff findings:

| Concern | Evidence and limit for this experiment |
| --- | --- |
| eMMC DMA | Exact package stop routine 0x81e05334 sets DMA control at +0x98, issues DSB, then polls active bit at +0x9c until clear (0x81e0535e..0x81e05362). Previously traced normal storage use supports storage DMA quiescence. Installed identity remains unverified. |
| Display / modem / connectivity bus masters | D08 omits identified framebuffer/modem/connectivity storage; first Linux enables none of their drivers. Final LED/GIC cleanup is not proof those masters cannot access low RAM. No new full-peripheral investigation or blind register sweep was undertaken. |
| CPU / secure state | Existing package SVC/r0-r2/cache/MMU contract remains the candidate architecture. D09 explicitly excludes hyp startup; no PSCI/SMP support is introduced. Exact installed loader and secure/shared-memory behavior still require corroboration. |
| Power | Fresh Android battery service still reports contradictory duplicated fields (100/50%, present true/false) while USB-powered. This is not trusted independent power evidence. No power transition was attempted. |

The watchdog finding alone is enough to reject the requested timing premise; additional broad peripheral bring-up is unnecessary to reach today's decision.

## Decision and smallest next evidence boundary

**NO-GO.** Observation, installed authentication, current-device recovery backup/operational procedure and watchdog/entry assurance remain open. No first experimental boot issue was created. A host-only script or another offline rebuild cannot supply the missing physical/installed facts.

Next work should obtain a safe acquisition/observation route: either verified UART hardware/pinout, or a fully specified supported USB accessory/readback route with the operator able to perform the required physical connection/power steps. Do not infer that the ordinary connected ADB cable meets either requirement. Acquire and independently retain current BOOTIMG (and required recovery/personalized evidence), establish installed loader/security lineage, and then resolve the normal-path watchdog policy before reconsidering GO. No preloader/LK/table/calibration write is part of that boundary.

Private evidence group `20260908-launch-gates/` includes exact command/status/UTC records, package slices, full preloader disassembly for audit, ROM_INFO values, pinned sources, local SPFT settings and artifact-preservation results. Hashes are in [capture-index.tsv](capture-index.tsv). Disassembly annotations are leads and were checked against local instructions at the cited branches; literal pools and sequential register annotations are not treated as proof of reachable execution or runtime values.
