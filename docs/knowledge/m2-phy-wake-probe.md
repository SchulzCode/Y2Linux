# M2-PHYWAKE-01 — bounded suspend-force release

2026-09-09, #27/#23 prerequisite. The [physical state](m2-usb-state-hardware-result.md)
shows clocks/supply usable, MAC disconnected/B-device, DMA controls zero and
PHY suspendm forced low. This is a diagnostic wake step, not USB enumeration.

## Exact scope and evidence

Preserve the existing PWRAP/clock/21-register snapshot. Under the same claimed
MAC/PHY windows, read seven additional PHY bytes: 00,05,15,1a,1d,22,63. They are
ordinary non-clearing registers corroborated by FM/LK byte accesses:

- FM usb_phy_recover: 00 at c04da024, 05 at c04d9fd8, 15 at c04d9f20,
  1a at c04d9df0, 1d at c04d9cd8.
- FM usb_phy_poweron: 22 at c04d9c08. LK savecurrent reads 63 at 81e093ac.
- FM usb_phy_poweron clears only force_suspendm bit 2 at c04d9c1c..c04d9c34
  and waits 800 us before subsequent device-mode forcing. LK 81e092da..81e092e2
  independently matches the bit clear and wait; FM recover c04d9d14..c04d9d20
  uses the same bit. Reuse pinned sources and existing focused disassembly.

Refuse before writing unless the full USB snapshot succeeded, HWVERS is the
observed 6503, POWER is the observed disconnected 20, DEVCTL B-device/host/session
bits are 80, all eight DMA words are zero, and digital PHY controls match the
observed passive state (68=00,69=00,6a=04,6b=02,6d=00,6e=00; IDDIG high).
Also require BC1.1 switch off (1a bit7), pull-up/down BIST off (1d bit4), DP/DM
100K pulls off (22 low two bits), and calibration ring oscillator off (15 bit7).
Any unknown/mismatched mode produces visible refusal and zero writes.

The kernel's only new write adapter re-reads 6a, refuses unless it is still 04,
then writes 00 once with writeb. It exposes no arbitrary address/value write API.
Wait 800 us. Re-read PHY68..6e, calibration-related bytes 00/05/15, MAC POWER and
DEVCTL. Report per-read validity and whether the write occurred. Require 6a=00,
unchanged calibration bytes and continued disconnected/B-device state; otherwise
report an error without retrying or compensating writes.

No clock/PLL/regulator, analog trim, calibration, BC1.1, pull-resistor, VBUS force,
MAC connection, interrupt, FIFO or DMA-control write is added. The remaining
vendor poweron/recover operations are deliberately outside this diagnostic:
they include forced VBUS signals and calibration changes. The comparator state
is reported rather than forced; no physical cable state or USB readiness is
inferred from DEVCTL alone. A released force bit is not proof of a ready PHY.

## Scope/validation boundary

This first PHY control write requires the standing scope audit, full existing
offline suite, production guard/fault tests, ARM PID1 fixtures, emitted single-byte
write review, and D08/layout/BOOTIMG checks. One clean build suffices; preserve
all unchanged ROM/source/recovery evidence. No RAM or DMA ownership change.

Only owner BOOTIMG testing may execute it physically. Keep the established
60-second power-on boundary and framebuffer fallback. There is no new USB driver,
IRQ handler, packet traffic or persistent calibration write. Observe before/after
force state and trims, and stop for the next hardware result. M2 remains open.
