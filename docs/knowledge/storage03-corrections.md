# Storage03 correction candidate

The owner's 2026-09-13 DIAG01 photos show Linux alive, internal MMC at 15269888
sectors, no exported partitions, and both filesystem resolvers absent/rejected.
The storage warning's command/argument is outside the photographed 60-column
window. The rejected opcode is unknown. USB is PREFLIGHT -19, configured=0,
polls=0, IRQ=0; initial CHRDET=007b, wake=-19/written=0. These are failures,
not physical acceptance. Original photographs are retained privately under
evidence-private/20260913-storage-diag01-owner.

The owner also reports cable-dependent startup, ineffective off-state buttons,
and apparent SD-dependent progress. Earlier no-SD console evidence proves Linux
can execute without SD; it does not prove internal Buildroot boot. Empty-slot
CMD55/CMD8 logs were obscuring rescue. There is no new evidence establishing
why stock power entry behaves differently. Kernel/root/data changes cannot be
claimed to repair a fault before Linux executes; no speculative PMIC, battery,
preloader, LK or MISC changes are made.

## Request boundary

Locked Linux 6.18 drivers/mmc/core/block.c prepares bounded multiblock requests
in mmc_blk_rw_rq_prep, and mmc_blk_part_switch may reselect EMMC_USER after its
partition cache is invalidated during error recovery. Storage03 accepts CMD23
only as a companion to a 512-byte CMD18/CMD25 transfer on the identified user
area, with the exact block count. Reliable-write and metadata-tag bits are accepted
only for range-checked writes, as required by Linux FUA/metadata requests; packed
commands and other flags are refused.
The main request must still pass the original root/data write bounds. A standalone
CMD23 remains denied. User selection accepts only a byte-for-byte unchanged
PARTITION_CONFIG with user access already selected; boot-enable/ack/reserved bits
cannot change. All boot/RPMB selection, erase/trim/sanitize and protected data
writes remain denied. MMC_CAP2_BOOTPART_NOACC suppresses boot-area enumeration.
Production eMMC uses the ordinary serialized request path instead of HSQ; the
working development/removable SD path is retained. The stock MT8135-compatible
host already implements bounded AutoCMD23 in msdc_cmd_prepare_raw_cmd.

This corrects unsupported request/recovery cases and avoids forbidden boot-area
probing. It does not prove which command the owner's truncated log rejected or
that its rejection alone caused the absent partition nodes. Short Y2GUARD lines
now retain opcode and argument on the display if a failure persists. No fallback
invented partition table, offset mount or internal formatting is introduced.

## Cable-present USB startup

The old driver latched -ENODEV permanently when the initial CHRDET was asserted;
its wake predicate also required the unplugged PHY6a=04 state. A historically
observed connected-start PHY6a=BE is a saved-current force state. Replugging cannot
restart a worker that was never scheduled.

Production's explicit DT property selects the MT6582 digital PHY recovery prefix.
The retained stock ELF's usb_phy_recover at c04d98ac, byte operations c04d98d8
through c04d9a18, agrees with donorSource/drivers/phy/mediatek/phy-mtk-u2-mt6582.c:
clear BIST, UART enable/force, force_suspendm, D+/D- pulldowns, XCVRSEL, TERMSEL,
DATAIN and their force controls; disable BC1.1 switch; enable VBUS comparator;
settle 800 us. This is followed by the existing checked peripheral session path.
The ELF is the retained Y2Player/reverse/ghidra/exports/y2-kernel-with-kallsyms.elf;
its symbols differ from the separately retained FM addresses in older M2 docs.
The older addresses must not be applied to this export. No full ROM audit repeated.

Recovery requires the existing exact power/clock/SoC identity checks, disconnected
MAC, B-device mode, zero DMA controls and only reviewed digital modes. Every
masked byte write is read back. Oscillator/trim bytes 00/05/15 and other controls
are checked for preservation; no calibration, PLL, supply or host VBUS write is
added. An active inherited controller or unknown mode remains a visible refusal.
The development profile retains its earlier one-bit wake sequence. Both cable
present and absent at Linux startup are handled by the production worker; actual
enumeration and reconnect are still physical acceptance items.

## Rescue and package

Production console loglevel 3 prevents expected empty-slot warnings from burying
status; full kernel logs remain buffered. Rescue prints a compact error, cached
USB status, internal partition geometry and shortened guard log directly to tty0.
It remains running without reboot, SD fallback or formatting. The Buildroot image
contains the matching Storage03 module/version; Y2DATA remains schema 1 with the
same owner public key and no private credentials. Existing Y2DATA is compatible
and can be preserved using the two-row profile. A fresh data template is supplied
for explicit reinitialization only. All stock partition boundaries and future
OTA/install contracts remain layout version 1.

Tests exercise real extracted request-guard code with Linux's actual READ/WRITE
flag values, bounded reads/writes, protected overlaps, malformed CMD23 and
unchanged-versus-mutated partition selection. PHY tests cover both cable states,
passive/saved-current states, active/unknown state refusal, each failed read and
write readback mismatch. Fixtures are not hardware proof. Complete image/package
validation follows the build; no claim of power-entry or no-SD success is made.
