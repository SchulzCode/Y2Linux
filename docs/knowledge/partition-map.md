# Partition map and acquisition boundary

Date: 2026-09-08. Task: [Y2E-110](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/3). Capture: `20260908-partitions`. Status: metadata reconciliation complete, raw acquisition NOT AUTHORIZED.

The [full 21-entry table](partition-map.tsv) retains scatter linear and physical byte addresses, runtime vendor values, Linux node mapping, 512-byte sector counts and unresolved cases. Source scatter SHA-256: `e5fe03e9f3219cc9b5ead27892f2ddb722acc16adce3306d27feb87893cd977e`. `/proc/dumchar_info`, `/proc/emmc`, `/proc/partitions`, mount records, aliases and explicit sysfs block metadata were read without opening any block device. Sixty bounded read-only commands captured 13 eMMC/SD nodes. Missing `start` files on whole disks/hardware boot regions are expected observations, not zero-valued partition offsets.

## Confirmed metadata relationships

Internal `mmcblk0` is 15,203,328 sectors = 7,784,103,936 bytes. Each eMMC boot hardware region reports 8,192 sectors = 4,194,304 bytes. The removable card is a separate `mmcblk1`; never infer its identity from an internal-storage partition number.

All eight `/proc/emmc` partition starts/counts match the corresponding sysfs values. PROTECT_F, PROTECT_S, SEC_RO, ANDROID, CACHE, USRDATA and runtime FAT lengths also agree with dumchar. Example: PROTECT_F starts at `0x4800` sectors = 18,432 × 512 = 9,437,184 bytes = `0x900000`; its `0x5000` sectors = 10 MiB matches vendor metadata. Normal fixed EMMC_USER scatter ranges from MBR through USRDATA have no overlaps and are within reported user capacity.

| Object | Scatter linear bytes | Scatter physical / runtime dumchar bytes | Length | Runtime mapping |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BOOTIMG | `0x3180000` | `0x1d80000` (30,932,992) | `0x1000000` (16,777,216) | parent `/dev/block/mmcblk0`, no dedicated partition node identified |
| RECOVERY | `0x4180000` | `0x2d80000` (47,710,208) | `0x1000000` (16,777,216) | parent `/dev/block/mmcblk0`, no dedicated partition node identified |

Scatter and runtime dumchar independently agree on these two ranges. They are metadata findings, not an executable readback contract: parent-device permissions and exact acquisition semantics still require resolution. File sizes of the packaged boot/recovery images are much smaller than their partition spans; packaged images do not cover all partition bytes.

The normal scatter linear address adds `0x1400000` relative to EMMC_USER physical address. It is not a physical offset to apply to a whole-device tool. Linux hardware boot regions are separate address spaces.

## Special cases that prevent a generic recipe

- PRELOADER: scatter/dumchar report `0x1400000` (20 MiB), whereas each eMMC boot region reports 4 MiB; dumchar maps it through `/dev/misc-sd`. The vendor span is not proven to be an actual region length. Do not transfer it into readback/flash coordinates.
- EBR1: vendor allocation is 512 KiB, while exposed `mmcblk0p1` contains two sectors (1 KiB). Start agrees. Lengths describe different scopes.
- FAT: scatter length is zero; dumchar/sysfs resolve it to `0x15dc00000`. This is dynamic allocation, not an empty partition.
- BMTPOOL: scatter physical `0xffff00a8` differs from runtime `0xfebf00a8`, and the value is not sector aligned. Semantics remain UNKNOWN; no range is approved.
- The packaged MBR/EBRs all have `55aa` signatures, but include `0xffffffff` length sentinels and vendor-specific extended layout. These are not generic partition-table repair inputs. Offline slot decoding is preserved in the private analysis record.

## Access, mutable data and recovery

`mmcblk0` and boot0 are root:system 0660, boot1 and partition nodes are root:root 0600. The current shell is uid 2000 and is not in the system group. Permission metadata does not demonstrate readable backup access; no open/read was attempted. `/emmc@...` aliases map the ordinary filesystems but do not provide a discovered boot/recovery shortcut.

NVRAM, PRO_INFO, PROTECT_F, PROTECT_S, SECCFG and MISC have no supplied package images. Their exact personalized contents and restore requirements remain UNKNOWN. Protect filesystems are currently writable/mounted, so a later backup also needs a consistency strategy. Do not replace personalized data with factory defaults. Sparse system/userdata package file length is not expanded filesystem size or a whole-partition backup length.

## Review decision

The map is adequate to identify the exact local stock boot input and constrain offline Y2E-115 analysis. It is not adequate to authorize a generic whole-device acquisition tool or any write. Special-region interpretation, access method, personalized data consistency and independent backup storage remain recovery blockers.
