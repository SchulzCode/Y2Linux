# USB DMA alignment evidence and current regression

<!-- knowledge-base-scope: maintained-summary; baseline02-sync 2026-10-03 -->

## Current Baseline02 / UART01 scope

UART01 passes three 1 MiB bidirectional USB checksum rounds with an independent Wi-Fi observer, after idle qualification, same boot and no filesystem errors. The current source retains alignment and progress-aware DMA protections. Earlier failed transfers remain historical evidence for those images; bounded success does not qualify large-transfer/reconnect/host-sleep endurance or USB host/VBUS.

[Baseline02 seal](../validation/Y2-BASELINE-02.md),
[UART01 hardware](../validation/Y2-CPU-C3-UART-PHYSICAL.md) and
[current state](../CURRENT_PLATFORM_STATE.md) carry exact identities, counters and limits.


## Historical source research and physical checkpoints

The following text retains earlier dated decisions and results. Its “current”,
“next” and candidate labels belong to those sessions; the Baseline02 summary
above takes precedence. Historical failures and seal-time NOT_RUN receipts
remain evidence for their exact images.

# Hardware Final: ECM request alignment and Inventra DMA

**Latest physical boundary, 2026-09-27:** Fix01 passes one 256-KiB
bidirectional hash transfer, then loses USB connectivity during the next
transfer while the display/UI remains usable. The failed-interval DMA/IRQ
observer was lost and the precise transport cause is unknown. Do not infer
that the earlier alignment correction failed, that the old IRQ storm returned,
or that sustained DMA/recovery qualified from a single small transfer.
[Fix01 physical report](../validation/Y2-CPU-FINAL-FIX01-PHYSICAL-QUALIFICATION.md#playback-connectivity-and-recovery).

2026-09-27 source correction; physical execution of the new kernel remains
pending. Hardware 02 reported an allocated Inventra controller while its DMA
IRQ counter stayed at six over large bidirectional ECM transfers. USB throughput
remained near the PIO baseline. Allocation is not evidence of payload DMA.

The pinned Linux 6.18 source explains a concrete mismatch:

1. `u_ether.c::rx_submit` allocates an aligned skb, then reserves
   `NET_IP_ALIGN` (two bytes) unless the gadget has `quirk_avoids_skb_reserve`.
   Hardware 02 does not select that quirk. USB receives into `skb->data`.
2. `musb_gadget.c::map_dma_buffer` maps that exact data pointer.
   `musbhsdma.c::dma_channel_program` rejects addresses not divisible by four
   for controller RTL 1.8 or later. Its comment documents hardware masking the
   bottom two address bits; bypassing the guard would corrupt data.
3. Transmitted Ethernet skbs commonly also start two bytes off a word boundary
   because their IP headers are aligned. Omitting the RX reserve alone does not
   fix this TX path. USB TX queues the final `skb->data` after protocol wrapping.

This strongly supports silent PIO fallback as the cause of the observed lack of
DMA progress. The old image does not expose actual request-address rejection
counters, so source analysis alone is not a physically observed DMA rejection.

The correction selects the existing gadget no-reserve quirk only after the Y2
DMA controller is successfully allocated. Explicit `y2.usb_dma=off` and DMA
allocation failure retain the previous PIO skb layout. A new pinned u_ether
overlay copies only misaligned TX buffers, after ECM/protocol wrapping, through
`skb_copy_expand` with word-aligned headroom. The kernel helper preserves packet
contents and checksum/header metadata. If atomic allocation fails, it keeps the
original skb and the existing controller alignment guard retains PIO fallback.
It never changes the frame on the wire or disables the hardware alignment guard.

RX changes where the Ethernet header resides, so IP/checksum alignment must be
considered explicitly. This Y2 config selects ARMv7 efficient unaligned access
and disables IPv6. The pinned ARM `csum_partial` has byte/halfword alignment
handling; `ip_fast_csum` uses single-word LDR instructions supported unaligned
on this CPU. An executable built from the exact `ip_fast_csum` assembly checks
2,816 IPv4 header patterns and lengths at both word and halfword alignment
against a scalar checksum. It passes ARM QEMU. This does not replace physical
DMA, checksum and data-integrity qualification, and is not an assertion about
other ARM architectures or future IPv6 configurations.

The existing DMA allocation/programming observer now also counts rejected
misaligned programming requests as `dma_alignment_rejects`. Accepted programming
bytes are deliberately not labelled USB delivery or application throughput.
Host tests execute the actual patched TX helper and cover no-copy, copy,
byte/metadata preservation, atomic allocation failure and original ownership;
DMA observer tests preserve callback return values and count alignment rejects.

Final same-boot qualification must capture the new counters before and after
RAM-to-PC and PC-to-RAM transfers, then storage-backed transfers. Require
increasing directional DMA program counts/bytes and IRQs, checked DNS/TCP,
payload hashes, stable RX/TX error counters, no DMA bus faults, and reconnect
and suspend recovery. Compare PIO only through the existing owner-controlled
boot fallback. A faster configuration is not qualified until its measured
throughput/CPU/temperature and failure behavior are retained. This repair needs
no intermediate flash to complete the independent campaign source work.
