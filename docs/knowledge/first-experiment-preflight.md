# Y2B-240 authorized preflight — 2026-09-08

The owner explicitly authorized issue #19 as specified: one diagnostic
BOOTIMG-only download, one normal boot observed for no more than 60 seconds,
then FM BOOTIMG-only restoration and stock function checks. Authorization is
recorded; no further flash permission is requested. The procedure and artifact
remain unchanged. This is a preflight checkpoint, not an experiment result.

## Verified host inputs and settings

- Fresh recovery verifier: all 24 FM files and SPFT executable/bundled DA pass.
- All 37 candidate bundle entries pass SHA256SUMS verification.
- Fresh real-artifact/D08/layout/wrapper/partition validation passes; all 11
  tests pass, including emitted watchdog instructions and guarded diagnostics.
- Candidate: `out/m1-risk-accepted-diagnostic/BOOTIMG.img`, 1,089,536 bytes,
  SHA-256 `db7d8a5cf082b37f77c8732bd8e1ab742e4205f9383e421b051917f17364ab7e`.
- FM fallback: 5,656,576 bytes, SHA-256
  `5ef1bdf28481ee0bf5f3528c1ddd91cf3f4d2d5f39e4d0ea049a8137a30f6af6`.
- Original FM scatter SHA-256:
  `e5fe03e9f3219cc9b5ead27892f2ddb722acc16adce3306d27feb87893cd977e`.
- SPFT 5.2032.00 running executable was independently hashed through
  `/proc/150273/exe` on the host: SHA-256
  `d618e7d08ba5a4020038921a95336a3805a4b2cf17a374fd308cc5299ea7d9d8`.
- Actual GUI DA is the original bundled `MTK_AllInOne_DA.bin`, SHA-256
  `46cd175d7556e6e80b13f6a70827c6931a5dfa25a09c3cc50e75ba7ff9327618`.
- Actual GUI shows original FM scatter, empty Authentication File,
  **Download Only**, and **BOOTIMG alone checked** with the exact candidate.
  The final setup log at 22:41:37 Europe/Berlin confirms the same file/size.
- All 20 normal partition entries in the retained BROM host setup log were
  reviewed: only BOOTIMG enabled. PRELOADER, MBR, EBR1/2, PRO_INFO, NVRAM,
  PROTECT_F/S, SECCFG, UBOOT/LK, RECOVERY, SEC_RO, MISC, LOGO, EXPDB, ANDROID,
  CACHE, USRDATA and FAT are disabled. Scatter BMTPOOL is reserved and
  `is_download: false`; it is not a selected target.
- GUI shows logical image interval `0x03180000..0x03289fff` inclusive.
  This does not change the audited physical BOOTIMG partition interval
  `EMMC_USER [0x01d80000,0x02d80000)`. No raw-address write is proposed.
- Existing setup reports USB high speed/auto-detect and DA checksum level 0.
  These are recorded existing settings; no verification/security option was
  changed. Host SHA-256 validation is not a device readback verification.

An intermediate GUI view selected the older `out/m1-first-boot/BOOTIMG.img`.
That mismatch was caught before Download and the subsequent GUI/log capture
confirms the authorized diagnostic path. Initial saved selections included
other ROM files; they are not the verified final selection. Setup-only desktop
interaction was stopped when concurrent window/selection changes were detected.

## Execution remains pending

No Download control has been activated by this session. The retained tool
snapshot contains setup activity, not a device flash result, and the GUI shows
0 Bytes / 0:00. Kernel diagnostics, PID1, heartbeats, resets/freeze, restoration
and stock functional results are **not observed / not performed**.

After host verification, read-only `adb devices -l` returned an empty device
list. Current target identity, cable/port, adequate charge, the owner's proven
power/USB sequence and a ready physical screen observer still need recording.
The desktop can be inspected, but there is no physical Y2 camera/UART feed;
the Linux candidate has no ADB. An unanswered readiness question is not an
observation channel or a power/recovery procedure.

Next step is physical coordination for the already-authorized experiment,
followed by rechecking actual tool settings immediately before Download.
Do not rebuild, substitute a candidate, retry, or expand to M2/full-ROM writes.
Issue #19 remains open until trial and restoration evidence is recorded.

Private raw evidence: `evidence-private/20260908-y2b240-preflight/`;
file hashes are retained in `capture-index.tsv`. Screenshots are desktop SPFT
configuration evidence, not photographs of Linux output on the Y2.
