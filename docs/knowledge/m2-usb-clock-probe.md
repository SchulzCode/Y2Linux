# M2-USBCLK-01 — inherited USB clock state

2026-09-09. Smallest next #27 prerequisite after
[physical PWRAP/VUSB success](m2-pwrap-hardware-result.md). Correct the source-
identified timer action-name parser error in the same localized candidate.

## Exact read-only contract

Read only four 32-bit always-on clock control/status registers. Do not enable,
disable, reset, switch or measure a clock, and do not access USB MAC/PHY/DMA or
analog calibration registers. A clock source selection number is raw evidence;
do not assign an unproved frequency to it. This determines the inherited gate
state before specifying safe MAC/PHY access or a minimal clock provider.

| Physical read | Meaning / exact FM corroboration |
| --- | --- |
| `0x10003018` | PERI_PDN0_STA. FM CG_PERI descriptor at `0xc09b1a6c` points to virtual `0xf0003018`; vendor clock ID 10 is PERI_USB0. Status bit 10=1 means gated. |
| `0x10000060` | CLK_CFG_2. FM MUX_USB20 descriptor at `0xc09b1900` points to `0xf0000060`, selector mask `0x70000`, gate mask `0x800000`, shift 16, three inputs. Preserve shared SPI/UART/MSDC fields. |
| `0x10209220` | UNIVPLL_CON0. FM UNIVPLL descriptor at `0xc09b1720` points to `0xf0209220`; FM USB clock enable at `0xc04d9b24` reads/modifies bit 26. Snapshot only, not a PLL programming contract. |
| `0x1020922c` | UNIVPLL_PWR_CON0. Same FM descriptor points to `0xf020922c`; observe raw inherited power/isolation controls. |

Pinned manufacturer `arch/arm/mach-mt6582/mt_clkmgr.c` at commit d53dd75,
SHA-256 `f73bbe0a4c3c07e2831e4c2bc5cabd3de7909c52e2ce572863fabfc46eadbc8d`,
corroborates the descriptors (`MUX_USB20`, `UNIVPLL`, `CG_PERI`) and ordinary
non-clearing register reads. Header/source and focused FM descriptor extraction
are retained under `evidence-private/20260909-m2-usb/`; existing FM provenance
is reused. [Manufacturer source](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/arch/arm/mach-mt6582/mt_clkmgr.c).

Claim each four-byte resource before mapping; refuse an existing claimant or
mapping failure. These providers are not enabled in the current kernel. Run only
after successful PWRAP/CID/VUSB reads with reported VUSB enable set. Cache all
results once per boot. Preserve a validity mask so partially acquired evidence
cannot be mistaken for a zero register. An MMIO bus hang itself is not software-
timeout recoverable; show the pre-probe stage before access and preserve the
established 60-second manual test/recovery boundary.

Show PWRAP RC/valid and CID/VUSB alongside CLOCK RC/valid, PERI/MUX and PLL/PWR.
No USB controller or PHY register is read until its prerequisite contract is
established. A successful clock snapshot is not an observed 48 MHz waveform,
USB enumeration or permission to alter a shared PLL.

## Timer parser correction

`timer-of.c` uses `np->full_name` as request_irq's action name. Match the complete
DT action token `timer@10008000` (optional leading slash), in a numeric IRQ row,
instead of `mtk-clkevt`; reject substring matches, unrelated timer addresses,
non-numeric counts and diagnostic summary lines. CPU0's first decimal counter
is sufficient because SMP remains disabled. The existing read limit is unchanged.

One clean build, affected parser/PID1/probe tests, emitted read-only adapter
review and D08/layout/BOOTIMG checks suffice: no memory, DMA or packaging policy
change. Hardware test must show increasing timer counts, continued heartbeat
through the STOP stage, and all raw clock fields/validity. #27 remains open until
its full controller/PHY/VBUS/FIFO/IRQ/DMA and host-log evidence is established.
