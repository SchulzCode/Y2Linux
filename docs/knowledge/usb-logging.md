# Host-readable USB logging — minimal path and controller gate

2026-09-09. [Y2B-255 #27](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/27). Research/planning only; no device access, code, build or flash.
Baseline: audited upstream v6.18 `7d0a66e4bb9081d75c82ec4957c50034cb0ea449`.

## Decision

Prefer **one CDC ACM function using built-in g_serial, peripheral-only MUSB,
PIO transfers, and a nonblocking PID1 log relay**. Host Linux would expose
`/dev/ttyACM<N>` (often ttyACM0); Y2 exposes ttyGS0. This uses the existing data
cable without ADB, network, mass storage, configfs orchestration or a shell.
The [kernel gadget-serial documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/usb/gadget_serial.html)
establishes this host/device interface, not MT6582 board readiness.

**Not yet a config-only implementation-ready Y2 port.** The gadget/logging
contract can be fixed now; the controller/PHY/clock contract cannot honestly be
filled with guessed sibling compatibles. Stop implementation at that gate.
No reliable smaller host-readable channel is currently established on this Y2.

## M2 execution update — 2026-09-09

The owner has activated M2 and prioritized this path. Focused FM/LK comparison
now distinguishes controller `0x11200000` from PHY `0x11210800`; it also confirms
FM's VUSB request and the AP PWRAP read transaction. Exact locators and the
[selected PWRAP/VUSB prerequisite](m2-pwrap-probe.md) are retained separately.
A bounded candidate will read inherited PMIC identity and VUSB enable status on
the existing screen. It does not enable this logging implementation. #23 and
#27 remain open; no physical USB enumeration or rail state has been observed.

Remaining USB contract includes clock-provider integration, PHY recovery and
analog trim differences, peripheral/VBUS behavior, FIFO/interrupt semantics and
inherited DMA quiescence. In particular, FM `usb_phy_recover` includes devinfo
conditionals and slew measurement; LK's selected trim branch is not mechanically
interchangeable with the generic vendor source. This probe performs none of
those analog/clock operations. A successful PWRAP read would resolve one supply
observation prerequisite, not the complete hard gate.

## Evidence reviewed

| Evidence | Finding / limit |
| --- | --- |
| Retained `20260908-stock/interrupts.stdout:4` | IRQ 64 identifies `musb-hdrc.0`; retained Android `mass_storage,adb` composition and owner ADB connection prove this connector has a stock USB device path. They do not initialize USB for Linux. |
| Vendor `mt_irq.h:51` | MT6582 USB0 is GIC_PRIVATE_SIGNALS + 32, consistent with the stock IRQ 64. SPI 32 is a candidate; final polarity/routing needs FM confirmation. |
| Vendor `mt_reg_base.h:202`; retained FM LK USB references | Vendor virtual USB_BASE 0xf1200000 and FM LK physical 0x11200000 references support the USB2 controller address. Do not reuse the vendor virtual address as DT reg. The PHY register window/offset convention needs separate reconciliation. |
| Vendor `mt_devs.c:163` and `usb20.c:786` | MUSB peripheral mode exists; vendor declares 16 endpoints and eight DMA channels; platform init supplies an 8 KiB FIFO layout and shared IRQ handling. These are vendor source facts, not a verified upstream FIFO configuration on this board. |
| Vendor `usb20.c:808` | Non-FPGA init requests MT6323 VUSB at 3.3 V. This is an internal supply, not permission to drive 5 V out of the USB connector. Exact FM/installed supply/handoff ownership is not yet pinned. |
| Retained vendor `usb20_phy.c:166,178,448` | PHY clock path manipulates UNIVPLL_CON0 bit 26 (48 MHz per comment) and MT_CG_PERI_USB0. Recovery performs USB/UART mux and PHY analog changes/delays; it is not a no-op transceiver. Actual FM sequence/calibration and inherited state remain unresolved. |
| v6.18 `drivers/usb/musb/mediatek.c` | Generic `mediatek,mtk-musb` match requires `main`, `mcu`, `univpll` clocks and a generic PHY. It programs a fixed eight-endpoint FIFO scheme and calls PHY init/power/mode functions. Do not infer MT6582 support from the generic match. |
| v6.18 `Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/mediatek,musb.yaml` | Enumerates mt8516, mt2701, mt7623; no mt6582. Requires reg/interrupts/phys/clocks. Current Y2 DT and upstream mt6582.dtsi supply none of the USB controller/PHY/clock-provider nodes. |
| v6.18 `drivers/phy/mediatek/` and retained clock audit | No established MT6582 USB PHY match or complete Y2 clock/power provider. MT2701 T-PHY is not evidence of identical older USB2 PHY layout. |

The five newly fetched vendor files are pinned to
[MediaTek source commit d53dd75](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/d53dd75c3ff77cac3f5be58fddfe660e94f94d64/).
Hashes and exact URLs are retained in `usb-logging-sources.json`; downloaded
source bytes remain in ignored `evidence-private/20260909-usb-logging/`. Vendor code is
reference evidence only. Previously retained FM bytes/symbols are the next
specific comparison input, not interchangeable with that public source tree.

## Smallest lower-layer prerequisite

One exact MT6582 peripheral-only controller contract must resolve: MMIO span,
SPI/polarity, endpoint/FIFO limits and IRQ acknowledge semantics; clock gates /
48 MHz source; PHY register layout, initialization/calibration and VUSB supply;
normal BOOTIMG handoff state, cable/VBUS detection, and inherited DMA stop.
Compare only the relevant FM `mt_usb_init`, `mt_usb_enable`, PHY/clock helpers
and normal LK USB cleanup against the sources above. No whole-ROM re-audit.
Use Y2E-160 #23 for shared PMIC/rail facts, extending its research to VUSB when
needed. This is the blocking proof, not physical UART, input, display takeover,
SD or full-RAM expansion. Do not implement a full PMIC/clock framework in this
logging issue just to avoid acknowledging the prerequisite.

PIO removes newly requested USB DMA transfers, **not inherited DMA activity**.
A reviewed controller stop/reset sequence must quiesce inherited channels before
PIO ownership; no dummy PHY, arbitrary fixed clocks, guessed full-speed-only
workaround, charger writes, host mode or unconditional VBUS drive is accepted.

## Fixed upper-layer implementation contract (after the gate)

- Built-in `USB_SUPPORT=y`, `USB_GADGET=y`, `USB_MUSB_HDRC=y`,
  `USB_MUSB_GADGET=y`, `MUSB_PIO_ONLY=y`, `USB_G_SERIAL=y`; `TTY`, `PRINTK`,
  `PROC_FS`, `SYSFS`, `COMPAT_32BIT_TIME` remain enabled. `USB=n` (host stack),
  MUSB host/dual-role and `USB_INVENTRA_DMA=n`. No DMA engine for USB.
- Existing MediaTek glue, **only if confirmed compatible**, needs
  `USB_MUSB_MEDIATEK=y`, `NOP_USB_XCEIV=y` and its selected GENERIC_PHY and
  USB_ROLE_SWITCH. The real PHY/clock configuration is a blocking prerequisite,
  not a missing option to guess. Any required MT6582 glue must be specified first.
- g_serial defaults to `use_acm=1`, `use_obex=0`, `n_ports=1`. Preserve its
  standard upstream gadget descriptors/IDs for this unchanged protocol; no stock
  Android VID/PID impersonation. `USB_G_SERIAL` selects USB_U_SERIAL, F_ACM,
  F_SERIAL, F_OBEX and LIBCOMPOSITE; LIBCOMPOSITE selects CONFIGFS_FS even though
  no configfs mount/setup or OBEX function is used. Account for resolved size.
- Leave `U_SERIAL_CONSOLE=n`; do not add `console=ttyGS0`. Kernel log retrieval
  uses `/dev/kmsg` with existing PRINTK. Keep the screen and UART0 as optional
  outputs; logging/boot must never await a host terminal or UART drain.
- Future DT changes are restricted to the reviewed USB node, `dr_mode=peripheral`,
  PHY and exact clock/supply references. Extend `tools/validation/dtb.py`'s
  explicit node/property whitelist for those reviewed nodes only. D08 memory,
  load addresses, framebuffer exclusions, CPU0 and watchdog remain unchanged.

## Log relay and host capture

Use the existing freestanding PID1; no BusyBox, systemd, adbd or login service.
Discover ttyGS0 major/minor from `/sys/class/tty/ttyGS0/dev`, create its node in
writable /dev; do not hardcode a dynamically assigned major. `/dev/kmsg` is
read-only char 1:11. Open both nonblocking, raw serial mode, no echo/flow control;
handle ENODEV, EAGAIN, EPIPE, partial writes and EINTR without blocking the
heartbeat. Preserve the fixed time32 sleep ABI and check every new syscall
against the actual linked kernel table.

A bounded `LOG1\n` request from the host starts/restarts a snapshot: firmware
build identifier, current PID1 state, retained `/dev/kmsg` records from the
oldest available sequence, then live kernel records and one PID1 status record
per heartbeat. Emit `KMSG_GAP` on ring overrun/EPIPE; sequence numbers distinguish
replayed records. PID1 retains its own bounded 8 KiB startup/status ring, with
explicit drop count. Use a maximum 32 KiB TX queue, maximum 8 KiB kmsg record
buffer, 16 records / 16 KiB processed per heartbeat pass, and bounded 16-byte
request parser. Finish partially transmitted records before advancing; report
truncation/oversized records explicitly. Never allocate without a cap or replace
kernel logs with screen-only summaries. New LOG1 resets replay deliberately.
No command execution, filesystem access requests or writable kernel-log endpoint.

A host script takes an **explicit selected tty path** and output directory,
verifies USB parent descriptors, sets raw 115200 8N1 with no flow control, opens
with DTR asserted for ACM, sends LOG1 and captures raw bytes plus host monotonic
timestamps/metadata for a bounded duration. Baud is an ACM line-coding convention,
not a physical UART requirement. Resolve identity via sysfs; ttyACM0 numbering
alone is not device identity. Do not stop ModemManager or alter global host rules
automatically. Host non-reader, late open and reconnect must not stall PID1.

Ring replay retrieves kernel messages emitted before USB enumeration only while
still retained in RAM. It cannot capture preloader/LK, decompressor or a fatal
hang before usable USB/PID1, and does not guarantee panic/crash delivery. Keep
that limitation explicit; no new persistent reservation is implied.

## Alternatives assessed

ADB requires a working USB UDC plus an extra userspace/protocol stack. USB network
or vendor bulk also require the same missing controller/PHY support and add
complexity; neither bypasses the gate. Electrical UART-over-USB needs an unproved
accessory, not an ordinary cable. Stock last_kmsg/ramoops retrieval has no proven
cross-boot layout/retention/reader contract and would change D08. Current screen
output is a functioning temporary aid but does not meet the requested host-log
channel. Therefore no smaller **reliable host-readable fallback** is claimed.


## Returned M2-PWRAP-01 hardware evidence

[Owner photographs](m2-pwrap-hardware-result.md) confirm RC=0/VALID=3,
CID=0x2023, VUSB=0xc000 and continued execution through BEAT 50. This resolves
the narrow inherited AP read-transport/VUSB-enable observation for this boot.
It is one cached snapshot, not repeated sampling, voltage measurement or battery
telemetry. Earlier pending/unknown statements describe the original handoff.
Next: [read-only USB clock handoff snapshot](m2-usb-clock-probe.md), with the
source-identified timer IRQ-name parser correction. USB ownership remains blocked.
