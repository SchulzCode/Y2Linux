# DEV-01 practical RAM reconciliation

2026-09-10; successor to [D08](initial-ram-map.md), authorized by the owner for
one integrated development candidate. This is an implemented, offline-validated
map. Its actual MemTotal, HIGHMEM operation and allocator stability remain to be
measured on the Y2. The latest physical evidence remains BASELINE-03 capture-02.

All intervals are physical, hexadecimal and half-open. Retained stock iomem
establishes the main bank `[80000000,be000000)` (992 MiB). DEV-01 describes that
bank directly, without importing LK ATAG sizes or reclaiming the high 2 MiB island.

| Occupant | Reservation or lifetime decision |
| --- | --- |
| Boot tags / low control data | Reserve `[80000000,80004000)` (16 KiB). Initial kernel page directory occupies the next 16 KiB and is owned by ARM startup. |
| Kernel and decompressor | Entry `80008000`; exact Image, BSS, relocated compressed input/DTB, stack and malloc intervals come from the built ELF in `layout.json`. All relocation remains below `81800000`; the historical 6 MiB kernel+DTB and 14 MiB resident-kernel caps remain enforced. |
| LK text, BSS, stack, initial heap | Reserve `[81800000,84000000)` (40 MiB). This includes LK at `81e00000`, BSS/heap start `81e55434`, and the uncertainty immediately above it. `84000000` is LK's established ramdisk copy destination, not a newly invented address. |
| Other LK heap allocations | Their exact former upper extent is unresolved. LK does not execute after its normal branch to Linux; dead CPU-only heap allocations are reusable. The 40 MiB reservation is a retained guard, **not a proved maximum heap extent**. Any surviving device-owned target requires separate containment; see below. |
| BOOTIMG staging | Existing LK wrapper/page/overread formulas are applied to the actual larger rescue payload. Staging is below `81800000` and may be reclaimed after the ramdisk copy. It is not a permanent allocation. |
| Rescue initramfs | Starts `84000000`, exact gzip end supplied in DT after packing. Kernel memblock reserves it until unpacking; initramfs pages/files subsequently belong to Linux. Caps: gzip 4 MiB, regular archive payload 8 MiB. |
| Donor connectivity alternative | Reserve `[bdf00000,be000000)` (1 MiB) inside the bank. This accommodates the donor's reservation without pretending it resolves the conflicting stock allocation. |
| Modem / shared memory | `[be000000,bf800000)` stays outside Linux RAM: inferred 22 MiB modem + 2 MiB shared from retained FM/default allocation, with historical modem overwrite evidence at `be000000`/`be800000`. |
| Alignment gap and display scratch | `[bf800000,bfa00000)` is not reclaimed. LK's framebuffer-minus-4-MiB scratch pointer `bf700000` and its uncertain extent remain in the excluded high envelope. |
| Stock connectivity alternative | `[bfa00000,bfb00000)` remains excluded, retaining both the stock-inferred and donor candidates. |
| LK framebuffer / preloader scratch / page tables | `[bfb00000,c0000000)` remains excluded. Includes the observed 5 MiB mtkfb resource, preloader scratch and top page-table base `bff00000`. The old diagnostic pixel aperture remains a guarded I/O mapping, never allocator RAM. |

The DT combines high ownership into a no-map reservation
`[bdf00000,c0000000)`. The portion inside the declared bank is 1 MiB; the rest
also documents containment for inherited display/modem/connectivity traffic.
The allocator therefore starts with **951 MiB minus 16 KiB**, before the kernel,
page tables, memmap, initramfs and other ordinary kernel reservations. This number
is an arithmetic budget, not a claimed observed MemTotal.

`PHYS_OFFSET=80000000`, `PAGE_OFFSET=c0000000`, non-LPAE ARM and `VMSPLIT_3G`
remain coherent. `CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y` allows pages above the kernel's chosen
linear-map limit to remain usable. The exact lowmem/highmem split depends on ARM's
vmalloc boundary and must be recorded from boot logs, `/proc/zoneinfo` and
`/proc/meminfo`. There is no guessed direct virtual mapping for high pages.
No CMA, raw `/dev/mem`, swap, crash kernel or hypervisor reservation is introduced.

## Bus masters and ownership

- OVL/RDMA/DSI inherit LK's excluded high display buffers until the bounded park
  and Linux commit. Linux DRM GEM uses the DMA API with a 32-bit mask; diagnostics
  compare the GEM physical address to actual OVL address after programming.
  Coherent scanout buffers are Linux allocations, not a fixed carveout in free RAM.
- Internal eMMC's native controller is disabled in DT; the original command
  firewall remains on its read-only compatible. Retained LK normal storage paths
  stop DMA and poll idle before returning. No internal disk is a root candidate.
- Removable MSDC1 at `11240000` checks inherited DMA-idle state before acquisition,
  then uses the upstream controller's descriptor/buffer DMA ownership. It uses
  the live decoded crystal source, maximum 13 MHz, one-bit SD; no eMMC/SDIO client
  or new regulator voltage is enabled.
- I2C APDMA uses only the exact controller channel and Linux DMA mappings. On the
  MT6582 error path reset now precedes unmapping/freeing the transfer buffers.
  One transfer per wheel interrupt; no added retry. The diagnostic records both
  controller and DMA state before reset.
- USB remains peripheral PIO, including ACM and ECM. No USB DMA or host mode.
  Endpoint FIFO allocation occupies 2144 bytes of the evidenced 8192-byte RAM.
- No new audio, GPU, camera, modem, connectivity or radio driver is enabled.
  Disabling a driver alone does not prove inherited DMA idle. Full secure-world
  or arbitrary bus-master containment is not established; retained known high
  targets are excluded and there is no claim that the reservations prove all RAM
  safe. This is an explicitly requested development qualification candidate.

After owner deployment, collect CPU online mask, dmesg, iomem, zoneinfo, meminfo,
buddyinfo and interrupts in one pass. Then `/usr/sbin/y2-memory-check` requests
128 MiB through the normal allocator, tests it once with memtester and frees it.
It refuses to start below 256 MiB MemAvailable. There is no physical-address
sweep, reserved-memory access or automatic repeated stress. Record failures with
the display, wheel, SD and USB findings for the same integrated iteration.
