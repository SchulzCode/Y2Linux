# CONNECTIVITY-05: frame the first WMT command over BTIF

CONNECTIVITY-04 completes this unit's MD calibration (`FS=841`, restore and
shutdown successful), verifies the corrected EMI remap and reads CONN chip
`6582`. It remains alive over 813 seconds, including a bounded runtime recovery,
with the same boot ID and no observed Oops/panic. The first WMT register read
times out after four seconds. All BTIF/DMA interrupt counters are zero; no Wi-Fi
interface or usable BlueZ adapter exists. This does not establish radio readiness.

## Targeted correction

The native bootstrap sent the 20-byte WMT chip-read command directly to BTIF.
Stock `wmt_core_stp_init` first selects BTIF mandatory STP mode (mode bit 3),
enables it, and then reads the chip register. Despite its name,
`wmt_core_reg_rw_raw` calls `wmt_core_tx` with **bRawFlag=false**. Donor
`mtk_wcn_stp_send_data` sends a four-byte STP header and two-byte trailer even
in mandatory mode; only sequence/ACK, header checksum and CRC are disabled.
The required first packet is 26 bytes, not 20.

CONNECTIVITY-05 frames bootstrap requests accordingly and parses replies using
their outer STP length. The inner WMT register-read length quirk remains limited
to the outstanding register command. Mandatory-mode replies have no transport
ACK. The existing negotiated full-mode CRC, ACK window and bounded retries stay
active after the mode switch. No HCI traffic is accepted before that switch.

BTIF FIFO clear bits are explicitly released before DMA starts, matching the
donor reset pulse convention. This is an initialization correction; it is not
claimed as a separately proven cause of the physical timeout. A WMT timeout now
records its opcode/mode and bounded BTIF/DMA control, occupancy and FIFO-pointer
values before shutdown. No payload, calibration, address identity or DMA buffer
address is logged. Clock ownership, I2C DMA channels and M4 policy are unchanged.

## Validation and scope

The regression executes the production STP send/receive functions: exact stock
bootstrap bytes, every reply split, one-byte fragments, disabled checksum/CRC,
the bounded register-event quirk, malformed frames, send failure, mandatory-to-full
transition, full-mode CRC rejection and duplicate suppression. It rejects the
previous bare-command implementation at the first wire-packet assertion.

Build a normal production BOOTIMG update retaining CONNECTIVITY-03 Y2ROOT and
all Y2DATA. The fallback is CONNECTIVITY-04 with that same root; its bounded
Linux stability is observed, but its radios remain unavailable. Do not recommend
the crashing CONNECTIVITY-03 BOOTIMG as recovery. No new firmware acquisition,
factory writes, memory layout change or broad milestone audit is involved.

After owner installation, first capture WMT versions/patch/calibration progress
and interface availability. Continue the existing M5 qualification only as those
gates pass. The new framing is source/test verified, not yet physically proven.
