# Y2B-240 — One risk-accepted BOOTIMG-only diagnostic experiment

**Prepared only. Separate explicit owner authorization is required before any
SPFT operation, DA upload, device mode change or flash.** The experiment uses
[D11–D13](risk-accepted-diagnostic.md), not the superseded Y2E-145 hard gates.
The final candidate hash and offline reports are in
[diagnostic result](../build/risk-diagnostic-result.md).

## Inputs and recovery already on this host

- Candidate: `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Linux/out/m1-risk-accepted-diagnostic/BOOTIMG.img`.
- Fallback: `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Player/y2_v3.2.0_FM-20260813/boot.img`,
  5,656,576 bytes, SHA-256
  `5ef1bdf28481ee0bf5f3528c1ddd91cf3f4d2d5f39e4d0ea049a8137a30f6af6`.
- Original scatter in that FM directory: `MT6582_Android_scatter.txt`, SHA-256
  `e5fe03e9f3219cc9b5ead27892f2ddb722acc16adce3306d27feb87893cd977e`.
- Owner-proven tool: `/home/luca/Downloads/SP_Flash_Tool_v5.2032_Linux/`,
  executable `flash_tool` version 5.2032.00, SHA-256
  `d618e7d08ba5a4020038921a95336a3805a4b2cf17a374fd308cc5299ea7d9d8`.
- Bundled `MTK_AllInOne_DA.bin`, SHA-256
  `46cd175d7556e6e80b13f6a70827c6931a5dfa25a09c3cc50e75ba7ff9327618`.
  The exact historical DA selection is unrecorded. Use the owner's working
  setup and retain the actual selected DA hash for this operation; no patched
  DA, substitute auth file or security-state adjustment.
- Local fallback boot/scatter convenience copies are also retained alongside
  the candidate under `recovery/`; they are not independent backup storage.

Before execution rerun `python3 tools/observation/verify_recovery.py` and verify
bundle `SHA256SUMS`. Any mismatch stops the procedure. Current installed
BOOTIMG is not backed up; the owner accepts returning to FM boot state.
The owner's successful same-device SPFT restore supplies the recovery evidence;
no destructive rehearsal is needed.

## Exact bounded operation after authorization

1. Record the authorization, candidate hash, target Y2 identity, date, tool/DA,
   selected USB cable/port and the owner's proven power/connection sequence.
   Ensure the owner can observe the screen and perform that recovery sequence.
   No UART adapter is required for this experiment. Start with adequate charge
   using the owner's ordinary indication; contradictory ADB battery records
   are not an independent battery measurement.
2. Open the owner's working SPFT v5.2032 setup. Load the **original verified FM
   scatter**, choose **Download Only**, deselect **every row**, select only
   **BOOTIMG**, and set that row's file to the exact candidate above. Keep all
   other locations/selection flags untouched and unselected. Review/record the
   final target list before starting; do not rely on saved checkbox indices.
3. Allowed target: **BOOTIMG, EMMC_USER [0x01d80000,0x02d80000)** (16 MiB).
   Let the verified scatter/tool resolve its addressing; do not substitute the
   logical 0x03180000 as a raw physical offset. No Write Memory, Readback-based
   write, Format All, Firmware Upgrade or automatic partition-table change.
   PRELOADER, UBOOT/LK, MBR/EBRs, NVRAM, PROTECT, SECCFG, SEC_RO, RECOVERY,
   ANDROID/system, USRDATA and every other partition stay unselected.
4. Perform one Download Only operation with the owner's proven attachment/power
   sequence. Retain the operation log. Abort on identity mismatch, authentication
   rejection, checksum failure, format/upgrade request, unexpected selected
   target or transport error. Do not disable verification or improvise a mode.
   A green SPFT result is transport evidence, not proof of Linux execution.
   Readback verification is useful if the supported workflow provides it, but
   is not a new absolute exact-backup gate under D11.
5. Perform **one normal stock-LK boot**, recording start time and visible
   transitions. Observe for **at most 60 wall-clock seconds from power-on**.
   No ADB connection is expected from Linux: it has no USB gadget/adbd. There
   are no shell commands or peripheral tests to run on the candidate.
6. Desired sequence: normal LK logo → black/white vertical stripes (kernel
   initcall) → solid green (PID1, after about two seconds) → white half moving
   left/right on green every five seconds → checkerboard after ten heartbeat
   intervals. Kernel/loader startup and console output add latency: these are
   not exact times from power-on. The 60-second host cutoff takes precedence.
   Stage timing depends on actual timer operation. UART0, if later connected
   safely, additionally emits `Y2DIAG` progress and error lines.
7. Success evidence is the ordered PID1/heartbeat sequence, with at least three
   timed changes. The terminal checker is stronger completion evidence. A
   stock logo, kernel stripes alone, static green, USB disconnect, backlight
   alone or reset alone is **not** successful first-boot evidence. On silence,
   unexpected colors/sequence, freeze or reset, stop at the cutoff and record
   exactly the last observation. No retry, RAM expansion or loader modification.
8. End the trial using the owner's known power/recovery sequence. Restore
   **BOOTIMG only** through the same verified scatter and **Download Only**
   selection, this time pointing the BOOTIMG row to the exact fallback FM
   `boot.img`. Record the selected rows, fallback hash and successful operation.
   Boot stock Android and check the owner's normal UI/storage/audio behavior.
   If FM boot alone cannot restore stock operation, stop: full-ROM recovery is
   a separate decision/authorization, never an automatic escalation of this test.

## Failure behavior and accepted uncertainty

The entry code disables AP_RGU and does not rearm it. Once this works, a later
hang may remain frozen; there is no guaranteed automatic reset, automatic
rollback, Linux power-button handler or safe programmed power-off. PID1 stops
its visual sequence after ten intervals and sleeps indefinitely. Manual
termination/recovery is part of the experiment. Before kernel entry or if the
watchdog write cannot take effect, the inherited nominal 10-second IRQ/dual-mode
interval, rejection/halt or repeated stock-loader reset may occur; no exact
reset timing is promised. Do not allow unattended repeated attempts.

Accepted risks include unsigned-image rejection, mismatch between installed
and analyzed loaders, absence of exact installed boot state, incomplete
DMA/secure/shared-state knowledge, and unmeasured watchdog/display behavior.
The visual guard fails closed on incompatible register state, so that failure
can still be silent without UART. A working guarded pixel path is supported by
firmware/source evidence, not yet demonstrated on this board under Linux.
Restoring FM boot loses current custom kernel/ramdisk changes; separately
required full-ROM restoration could lose current system/userdata. Generic ROM
files do not recreate unique calibration. None of these tradeoffs authorizes
writes to loaders, partition tables or calibration regions in this experiment.

Close this issue only after the authorized operation, observations and stock
restoration results are retained and interpreted. M1 hardware completion is
not implied by offline GO.

Execution checkpoint: [Y2B-240 / #19](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/19), awaiting separate owner hardware authorization.
