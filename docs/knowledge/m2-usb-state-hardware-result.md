**CONFIRMED:** all 21 guarded MAC/digital-PHY/DMA-control reads complete and
PID1 continues without a reported error through BEAT 50. Both photos show the
same cached snapshot, not repeated DMA sampling. Timer delta 4329 over 43.29
kernel uptime seconds is consistent with 100 Hz, not independent host timing.

POWER 0x20 has high-speed enable set and soft-connect clear. DEVCTL 0x80 reports
B-device, host/session clear and VBUS below the valid threshold; physical cable
state was not supplied and cannot be inferred from an inactive PHY. HWVERS
0x6503 is recorded raw, not promoted to a silicon identity or sibling compatibility.
DMA controls are zero at the snapshot, not an ownership/quiescence guarantee.
TX/RX/USB masks remain inherited; no Linux USB IRQ handler is installed.

PHY 0x6a=04 forces suspendm while 0x68's suspendm value is zero. UART force/enable
are clear. This identifies the smallest next functional step: guarded release of
that single force bit, after reading/checking remaining mode controls. See
[the PHY wake contract](m2-phy-wake-probe.md). Analog trims/calibration and VBUS
forcing must be preserved; no full vendor recover sequence is justified yet.

Photos identify the build; selected/flashed/readback hash, cable state, independent
host timing and restoration outcome remain unreported. M1 stays complete,
#23/#27/#28 stay open, and M2 exit is not met.
