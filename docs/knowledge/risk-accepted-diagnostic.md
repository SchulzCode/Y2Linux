# D11 — Risk-accepted first diagnostic boot policy

2026-09-08; Y2E-150 [#18](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/18).
The owner's latest instruction supersedes the absolute authentication, exact
installed BOOTIMG backup, and complete inherited DMA/secure-state gates in the
previous Y2E-145 assessment. These remain uncertainties, now accepted for one
bounded experiment. No hardware flash is authorized by this decision.

Unchanged requirements: BOOTIMG only, stock preloader/LK untouched, no formatting,
repartitioning, system/userdata/rootfs changes; verified owner-proven FM/SPFT
fallback; watchdog handling and useful observation. D08 allocator memory and all
artifact caps remain exact. A separate GO issue and owner flash authorization
are required. No automatic RAM expansion or security-state changes are allowed.

## D12 — Entry watchdog stop

Upstream v6.18 `mt6582.dtsi` supplies AP_RGU 0x10007000 and compatibles
`mediatek,mt6582-wdt`, `mediatek,mt6589-wdt`. In `drivers/watchdog/mtk_wdt.c`,
`mtk_wdt_init` recognizes an enabled watchdog and reloads its timeout; it does
not stop it. Registration can arrange core servicing, but normal driver probe
cannot cover the interval before decompression/initcalls or promise arrival
before the inherited deadline. Merely enabling that driver is insufficient.

Use the same keyed MODE read/clear-ENABLE/write as upstream `mtk_wdt_stop` and
FM LK disable helper 0x81e10ddc. Insert the board-specific operation immediately
after masking interrupts in compressed/head.S, before stack, relocation and
inflation. Only scratch r0/r1 are used; saved r7/r8/r9 and loader artifacts are
preserved. Key 0x22000000, clear bit 0, DSB and readback. If still enabled, do not
continue. An explicit branch into the text continuation skips linker padding;
the emitted branch target is validated in addition to the stop instructions. No length, reset-request, security, PMIC or display register writes.
The diagnostic kernel rechecks MODE disabled before exposing a visible stage.

This stops the identified AP watchdog, not every possible watchdog. A hang
before entry, loader authentication rejection, inaccessible RGU or an already
pending reset can still fail/reset. No guaranteed reset delay is claimed. Once
stopped, a later kernel hang can remain frozen until the owner uses the proven
power/recovery sequence. No automatic repeated boot/reset is requested.

## D13 — Guarded inherited video diagnostic

Exact FM LK input SHA-256:
`bb1a93b4c1f02eab09ebad1314a8fdc25d94d3ca99771fc14e21cb18a289964a`.
FM kernel was remapped using its own recovered symbols, not old kernel offsets.
Private evidence: `20260908-risk-diagnostic/`.

- FM panel parameter functions at 0xc04a2314 / 0xc04a25f8 describe 480x360 DSI;
  mode at parameter +0x130 is 1 (sync-pulse video). LK corresponding parameter
  setup at 0x81e1ee00..0x81e1ee94 agrees; the embedded panel name includes
  `st7701_hvga_dsi_vdo_boe`. This does not prove an installed panel revision.
- Stock ADB fb0 metadata: 480x1080 virtual, 32 bpp, stride 1920. This is Android
  triple-buffer metadata, **not LK's pixel layout**.
- LK display init 0x81e0a470 computes page span
  align16(480)*align16(360)*2 = 353280 (0x56400). Layer 2 starts at framebuffer
  base, layer 3 console at base + page. Both use format enum 1 / RGB565 and
  960-byte rows. Layer 2 is 480x360 at (0,0). Scratch base minus 4 MiB is not a
  diagnostic buffer. The framebuffer reservation is [0xbfb00000,0xc0000000).
- Drawing uses base or base + 3*0x56400 = 0xbfc02c00, through
  0x81e0a7fc / 0x81e0a854. Normal BOOTIMG continuation calls 0x81e0a9c4 at
  0x81e18464. That routine waits for update; if the next draw offset is zero,
  copies the last logo from page 3 to base and switches layer 2 to base.
  Otherwise base was already selected. Thus normal final scanout converges on
  **0xbfb00000**, not Android's active framebuffer index.
- LCD_ConfigOVL 0x81e0db00 calls 0x81e13730, then layer config 0x81e12a84.
  Layer-2 case 0x81e12e38..0x81e12f14 programs CON at 0x14007070,
  size +0x78, offset +0x7c, address +0x80 and pitch +0x84. Format is bits
  15:12 = 1; memory source bits 29:28 = 0. The backing struct initializes
  source/alpha/key disabled for layer 2. Exact binary corroborates vendor
  definitions; do not confuse virtual f400xxxx with physical 1400xxxx.
- Continuous video requires no per-frame CPU start operation. DSI registers
  at 0x1400c000 START, +0x10 COM_CTRL, +0x14 MODE_CTRL identify running,
  enabled, non-reset sync-pulse video (frame/mixed/sleep modes excluded).
  Normal final platform cleanup does not stop this engine. Its LED cleanup
  0x81e115c4 turns off LEDs 0,1,2, **not backlight 6**. Backlight-off caller
  0x81e182a6 is a conditional charging-mode reboot, not normal boot.
- Linux's minimal config has no display/PM/clock-gating driver to turn this
  inherited path off. Persistence for the actual board is an experiment to
  observe, not a claimed successful hardware capture.

Implementation policy: only on `innioasis,y2`, read a bounded whitelist of
AP_RGU/OVL/DSI configuration registers. Require watchdog disabled, expected
running video and enabled layer 2, exact base/size/pitch/offset/RGB565 memory
source, alpha/key disabled. Refuse all pixel writes on mismatch; UART reports
failure. No fallback addresses or runtime register programming. Map only
[0xbfb00000,0xbfb54600) = 345600 visible bytes using ioremap_wc; this is an
explicit nonallocatable diagnostic aperture inside the existing excluded high
framebuffer, **not a new DT RAM bank**. Write 16-bit pixels with ordered I/O and
a completion barrier. Never touch the high scratch/other pages or low D08 RAM
outside ordinary allocations. Read-only OVL/DSI mappings never receive writes.

A built-in board diagnostic marks kernel initcall progress with black/white
stripes. PID1 writes a one-byte command to its dedicated root-only proc endpoint
for solid green after a two-second stripe hold, then ten five-second heartbeat transitions with a white
half alternating on green. After ten intervals it displays a terminal
checkerboard and emits no further heartbeat. No display reinitialization,
page flip, clock/pinmux/panel/LED/backlight programming or framebuffer device
stack. Procfs is mounted nosuid/nodev/noexec but writable for this volatile
PID1-only endpoint; sysfs remains read-only. UART0 remains additional output. Greyscale and green avoid red/blue
ordering ambiguity. Tearing and bootloader console overlay are acceptable;
stale logo, stripes alone or static green are not full success.

## Recovery tradeoff

Fallback is owner-proven FM boot.img, not a current-device backup. Restoring it
replaces any installed custom kernel, ramdisk, init/adbd configuration and
boot-specific changes. Compatibility with the currently installed Android
system is not guaranteed; full FM restoration might be needed. Such a later
whole-ROM operation requires separate authorization and can replace system and
lose userdata depending on targets/mode. It is **not** part of this BOOTIMG-only
experiment. A generic ROM cannot recreate unique NVRAM/calibration. Preloader,
LK, partition tables and personalized partitions remain prohibited targets.
