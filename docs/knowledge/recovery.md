# Recovery baseline

> For the risk-accepted first experiment, verified owner-proven FM boot.img restoration is sufficient; an exact current BOOTIMG backup is optional. See [D11 recovery tradeoff](risk-accepted-diagnostic.md#recovery-tradeoff). All 24 ROM files and SPFT/DA were rehashed in Y2E-150; neither loader was changed. Later full-ROM recovery would require separate authorization and may lose current software/userdata.

Date: 2026-09-08. [Y2E-125](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/6) updates [Y2E-120](https://github.com/SchulzCode/Y2Linux/issues/5). **Known-good owner-observed SP Flash Tool recovery/flash exists. M0 remains open because device-specific backups and experiment prerequisites are incomplete.** This is an evidence assessment, not an executable flashing procedure.

## Owner-confirmed history: accepted evidence

The owner reports personally successfully flashing **this Y2** with SP Flash Tool obtained from [spflashtool.com](https://spflashtool.com/) and the ROM at `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Player/y2_v3.2.0_FM-20260813/`.

Classification: **CONFIRMED owner observation**, strong evidence of a working tool/package/device combination. This supersedes the earlier assessment that no compatible tested combination or same-device restore evidence existed. We do not need to establish SP Flash Tool's recovery viability from scratch or deliberately repeat a restore to accept this history. The website is the owner's stated download source; its current headline version is not evidence of the previously used version or manufacturer provenance.

The successful operation's date, precise target selection/mode, DA choice, USB entry sequence and recorded post-flash checks are not supplied. Current local hashes identify bytes inspected today, not a retroactively verified historical checksum. This distinction does not diminish the reported successful recovery, but prevents inventing a fully reproducible runbook.

## Exact local tool identification

Found `/home/luca/Downloads/SP_Flash_Tool_v5.2032_Linux/` and its ZIP. Offline ELF inspection resolves `ToolInfo::ToolName()` and `ToolInfo::VersionNum()`: format strings and constants identify **MediaTek SP Flash Tool v5.2032.00**, detailed version **5.2032.00.sn100**, build string `2020/08/11 13:36`. The version is derived from executable code, not merely the folder name. The flasher was not executed.

Its `history.ini` points both `lastDir` and `scatterHistory` to the owner's exact FM scatter. The installed executable matches the archived executable byte for byte. Together these make this build the **strongly corroborated previously used local tool**, although no operation log proves the exact executable/DA/settings of the successful write.

| flash_tool | 11,392,491 | `d618e7d08ba5a4020038921a95336a3805a4b2cf17a374fd308cc5299ea7d9d8` |

The DA is a hashed **bundled candidate**, not a confirmed selection during the successful operation. Launcher, libraries and history are additionally hashed in [handoff-artifacts.tsv](handoff-artifacts.tsv); private `spft-version-disassembly.txt` records the offline version proof. Historical Y1/MT6572 tool-package observations remain in prior history/manifests but are no longer the preferred recovery evidence. Do not use that Y1 scatter on this Y2.

## Exact owner-ROM identity

All 24 top-level regular ROM files were hashed without modification; see [handoff-artifacts.tsv](handoff-artifacts.tsv). There is no claim that these are full per-device partition backups.

Scatter and LK match OriginalFirmware; preloader/kernel/boot/recovery/system differ. Keep package lineages separate. The FM set is now the owner-proven same-device fallback, replacing the former equal-ranking of untested candidates. Exact current installed build/PCB details still need recording for a precise future operation, not for re-proving the owner's history.

## Remaining safeguards and evidence gaps

| Requirement | Updated assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Working recovery/flash method | **Established by owner observation**, corroborated by local tool/scatter history. |
| Identifiable compatible package | **Owner-proven FM package**; current local files/scatter fully hashed. |
| Exact historical tool build | v5.2032.00 / 5.2032.00.sn100 strongly corroborated; operation log absent. |
| Exact DA/mode/targets/connection procedure | Incomplete historical details; record before a future operation. |
| Recovery independent of functioning Android | SPFT history is strong evidence of the MediaTek recovery route; exact emergency entry conditions with damaged BOOTIMG are not separately recorded. No intentional damage test is needed. |
| Same-device boot/recovery and personalized backups | Not established by this research; factory/package images do not substitute. |
| Independent backup copies | Not established. Private research captures on this host are not independent partition backups. |
| Power/capture consistency | Battery reporting conflict and mutable protect/NVRAM consistency strategy remain unresolved. |
| Linux boot experiment | Still gated by memory/observation/installed-loader evidence and backups. |

Preserve NVRAM, calibration, protect/security data and individual radio identity. Preserve preloader/LK and partition tables during ordinary bring-up. **No Format All, destructive formatting, automatic repartitioning or preloader write is authorized.** A successful historical flash does not make those operations safe or recreate lost personalization. No generic factory file may be treated as a calibration backup.

A later acquisition proposal must pin exact tool/DA, connection behavior, region/offset/length semantics, consistency state, expected output bytes, hashes and abort conditions. A readback feature does not make loading a DA or switching device mode a passive operation. Current non-root block permissions provide no already-approved raw-read route. Retain and verify a second independent backup copy before experimentation.

A future bounded restore runbook should record the owner's proven sequence, exact package/tool selection, target list, USB/host/power prerequisites, timeouts and functional/calibration checks. Exclude preloader/LK, tables, calibration and formatting from ordinary restoration. Execute no restoration in this research session. Existing successful owner recovery satisfies the known-method evidence; a new full-flash rehearsal is not imposed merely to reconfirm it.

## Current M0 gate and next boundary

- [x] Stock-family artifacts and owner-confirmed FM fallback hashed; failed generated distributions kept separate.
- [x] Non-root baseline and ordinary partition layout reconciled.
- [x] Package boot structure and actual LK load/ATAG contract analyzed.
- [x] Successful same-device SP Flash Tool recovery/flash accepted and local build corroborated.
- [ ] Current-device image lineage and exact future recovery procedure/DA recorded sufficiently for the bounded operation.
- [ ] Same-device boot/recovery/personalized backups verified with independent retention.
- [ ] Power/capture consistency and safe acquisition procedure established.
- [ ] Safe initial RAM exclusions, observation channel and installed-loader launch policy resolved.

The next main research proof is the [boot memory envelope](boot-chain.md), not another broad investigation of whether SPFT works. Recovery work should fill the concrete remaining backup/runbook gaps using the known-good history. M0 remains open; no Linux boot artifact or implementation issue is ready.

## Y2E-130 boundary

The [fixed initial RAM policy](initial-ram-map.md) permits bounded offline artifact work; it does not pass M0 or change recovery authorization. Owner-confirmed SP Flash Tool recovery remains accepted. Per-device backups/independent retention, exact procedure and trusted power remain incomplete; inherited DMA/secure state, installed-loader/security and observation-channel checks still precede a hardware experiment. No device operation or boot artifact was produced during this research.

## M1 offline boundary

A [validated offline BOOTIMG candidate](../build/first-boot-result.md) now exists under the owner's later implementation authorization. This changes neither the accepted SPFT recovery history nor the open backup/DA/entry/power requirements. M0 remains open. [The conditional experiment](first-boot-launch-gates.md) specifies a later BOOTIMG-only target and restore concept; it cannot be executed until the missing operator/backup/console/security evidence is supplied and the bounded operation is separately authorized. No new flash, readback, DA execution, ADB or device operation occurred. Earlier no-artifact statements describe their dated research phase.

## Y2E-145 current-device recovery assessment

Fresh shell uid/group and device-node permissions confirm that mmcblk0, bootimg and uboot are not readable through current ADB access; no raw acquisition was performed. **Current BOOTIMG backup and independent copy: absent.** Live dumchar still identifies EMMC_USER [0x01d80000,0x02d80000), 16 MiB. Tool/DA hashes were reverified; configured SPFT log directory is absent, and available-scene flags/unchecked historical settings cannot prove the old DA/mode/targets. Owner success remains accepted.

[Prepared BOOTIMG-only acquisition/restore runbook](bootimg-recovery-runbook.md) fixes physical addresses, exact bytes, input hashes, repeat-read verification, independent retention and BOOTIMG-only Download Only selection. Exact DA/connection/power and bounded transport/image acceptance remain open; it was not executed. [Launch decision](launch-readiness.md): NO-GO, also due to observation/authentication and the newly identified normal-path watchdog risk. No preloader/LK/table/calibration or other partition operation occurred.
