# M2-PWRAP-01 physical result

2026-09-09, owner-supplied photographs `10.jpg` and `50.jpg`. Originals are
under `out/m1-y2b250-time32/`, but both screens identify **M2-PWRAP-01**, kernel
`6.18.0-y2-m2-pwrap1`. Retained private copies/manifest:
`evidence-private/20260909-m2-pwrap-result/`. This is real photographed hardware,
not a rendered fixture. The filename `10` is not the displayed heartbeat.

## What this establishes

**CONFIRMED narrow prerequisite:** on this boot the inherited AP PWRAP transport
completed CID and VUSB reads and returned to idle; CID low byte is MT6323 `0x23`.
VUSB `0xc000` has software enable bit 14 and reported enable bit 15 set. This
supports preserving the inherited supply for the next USB study. No rail enable
write is needed merely to discover its state. These fields are one cached
snapshot, not two independent bus reads or evidence of continuous rail monitoring.
They do not measure 3.3 V or qualify battery/charger telemetry.

The kernel/PID1 remains observable through BEAT 50, with 35.52 seconds of kernel
uptime between the photographed states. Those are kernel times, not an independent
host-clock accuracy measurement or repeated-boot qualification. MemTotal is
21.6875 MiB under D08; application/subsystem working-set sufficiency is untested.

## Timer diagnostic cause

Pinned v6.18 `drivers/clocksource/timer-of.c:66–68` registers the interrupt action
with `np->full_name`, while `timer-mediatek.c` names the clock-event object
`mtk-clkevt`. The PID1 parser incorrectly searches for that clock-event name in
`/proc/interrupts`. The board DT node is `timer@10008000`; a source-backed parser
fix must match the actual action token and numeric IRQ row. The raw hardware
interrupt listing is not supplied, so the precise rendered action string/count
is still to be confirmed. -61 is the parser's no-data result; it does not show
that timer IRQs are absent. Working sleeps and progress remain confirmed.

## Identity and remaining boundaries

The associated candidate is [the retained M2-PWRAP-01 image](../build/m2-pwrap-01-result.md),
SHA-256 `c51102c861d65d39f5af2425ed73e9c1ba21d8adaae1b016f450a58630946ac0`.
The screenshots identify the build, but do not independently confirm selected
or flashed/readback SHA-256. Host elapsed time, cable state, reset history and
restoration outcome have not been supplied. Do not infer them from the folder
name or photographs. M1 remains complete; #23, #27 and M2 stay open.

Next: correct timer reporting and resolve normal-handoff USB clocks/PHY/DMA.
Only the scoped PWRAP/VUSB prerequisite has advanced to physical evidence.
