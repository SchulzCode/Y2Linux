# M2-CHRDET-01 physical result

2026-09-09, implementation `de1a6d0`. The owner supplied three photographs in
`out/m2-chrdet-01/` and reports no error when starting without USB, but error
`-19` when starting with USB connected. All show M2-CHRDET-01 and Linux
6.18.0-y2-m2-chrdet1. Filenames describe startup cable state; they do not certify
same-boot chronology or BEAT 50.

**CONFIRMED:** the cached PMIC status read succeeds in both reported startup
conditions; CHRDET tracks the supplied cable-state reports. This is charger
presence, not proof of host identity, data-wire integrity, electrical voltage
or a usable MUSB session. The connected boot is visibly running at BEAT 10.
The no-USB photographs show successful guarded wake and progress as late as
BEAT 46; the owner has not explicitly confirmed that those two images share a
boot. No connected-boot BEAT 50/STOP or continuous stability is claimed.

## Why -19 appears

`y2_usb_wake_probe()` starts with result -19 and refuses its initial guard unless
the complete snapshot matches the reviewed passive state. In particular,
PHY6a must be 04. The connected photograph shows **BE**, with `written=0` and
both wake validity masks zero. This establishes refusal before the seven extra
mode reads and before any PHY write. It is not a failed CHRDET/PWRAP transaction,
a kernel boot failure, or a failed write of zero to 6a.

The old PID1 screen replaces the valid original USB rows whenever all USB reads
succeeded, even when the subsequent wake guard refused. Consequently its
`BE>00`, zero post-PHY, zero mode/trim and `P:00 D:00` fields contain unread
zero-initialized storage. Those zeros are **not hardware evidence**. Other
initial guard failures may coexist with 6a=BE; the original MAC, remaining PHY,
DMA and IRQ-enable values were collected but hidden.

The earlier successful attached-cable PHY-wake report remains valid within its
reported conditions. Exact cable attachment timing relative to startup is not
established there. Do not equate “attached during observation” with “attached
at power-on,” erase that success, or infer the loader's complete mode from BE.

## Next evidence boundary

[M2-USBGUARD-01](m2-usb-guard-diagnostic.md) changes diagnostic presentation only:
retain the captured initial state on an early refusal and mark unread values
with dashes. All register transactions, guards, snapshot ABI, memory/DMA and
boot packaging policies remain unchanged. Obtain the connected-start raw state
before selecting a stock-derived PHY recovery/session operation. CHRDET=1 alone
does not authorize bypassing the passive-state guard or forcing VBUS.
