# Y2B-240 result — Linux PID1 evidence and Android recovery

2026-09-08. The single diagnostic candidate transfer completed and the owner
observed a green Y2 display. Android was restored through a second BOOTIMG-only
transfer and the owner reports normal operation. **Linux boot to PID1 is strongly
supported; timed heartbeat success is not established.** This concludes this
experiment, not the remaining M1 diagnostic validation. No further boot is implied.

## Actual operation and evidence

Times below are SPFT host timestamps, Europe/Berlin, not device power-on times.

| Event | Recorded result |
| --- | --- |
| Candidate operation | Download Only started 22:46:10; USB 5-2, VID:PID 0e8d:2000, ttyACM0 detected 22:46:14; S_DONE(0) at 22:46:17 |
| Candidate transfer | BOOTIMG alone, 1,089,536 bytes; authorized diagnostic path; SHA-256 `db7d8a5cf082b37f77c8732bd8e1ab742e4205f9383e421b051917f17364ab7e` |
| Observation | Owner: “y2 screen is green”; no photograph/UART log or timed sequence supplied |
| Interrupted host wait | Download Only USB wait started 22:50:39, stopped by user 22:50:48; no target connection/image transfer in that wait |
| Restore operation | Download Only started 22:51:28; same USB port detected 22:51:43; S_DONE(0) at 22:51:46 |
| Actual restore image | `/home/luca/Dokumente/Code/Y2Player/out/boot-adb/boot.img`, 5,875,712 bytes; SHA-256 `275870974bbecc74233761753187ee478bfe79ca9d2f2818facd6e0c039c6b43` |
| Android result | Owner reports device works as expected; fresh ADB sees Y2 on USB 5-2, sys.boot_completed=1, stock Linux 3.4.67 and Android 4.4.2 fingerprint |

Actual DA: original bundled `MTK_AllInOne_DA.bin`, SHA-256

`e5fe03e9f3219cc9b5ead27892f2ddb722acc16adce3306d27feb87893cd977e`.
GUI and logs retain Download Only, empty auth file and BOOTIMG alone selected.
DA checksum level 0 was the existing setting. Transfer checksums are logged;
there is no independent post-write SHA-256 readback. Both actual transmitted
images are BOOTIMG; no other ROM image transfer is logged. Preloader/LK and
the other normal partition entries were disabled; BMTPOOL is reserved/non-download.

The physical BOOTIMG partition remains EMMC_USER [0x01d80000,0x02d80000).
SPFT's logged 0x03180000 is its logical address, not a new raw addressing rule.
The owner operated the physical device and download controls; the assistant
performed host verification/log inspection and read-only Android checks.

## Interpretation and limits

The reviewed diagnostic paints full green only when its proc endpoint receives
`I` from task PID1. That endpoint exists after the built-in kernel initcall,
and each paint rechecks the watchdog-disabled and inherited-display guards.
Taken with the exact candidate transfer and owner observation, this strongly
supports installed LK accepting this image, Linux decompression/startup, usable
static-DT RAM, initramfs execution, PID1 and the guarded framebuffer path.
This is functional evidence for this image/device state, not a complete audit
of loader security, all RAM, DMA safety or watchdog behavior over time.

Preceding stripes, white-half changes, terminal checkerboard, reset/freeze
behavior and power-on/power-off times were not reported. Do not infer they
failed merely because only green was reported. Do not claim the required three
timed heartbeat changes or verify the 60-second cutoff from flash timestamps.
The two-second sleep result is logged but is not checked before PID1 paints
green; green therefore does not independently validate timer accuracy.

Recovery differs from the planned runbook: the owner restored `out/boot-adb/boot.img`,
not original FM boot.img (SHA-256
`5ef1bdf28481ee0bf5f3528c1ddd91cf3f4d2d5f39e4d0ea049a8137a30f6af6`).
Record the actual successful Android recovery; do not call it an exact FM restore
or exact current-image backup. No additional corrective flash is needed just
to make history match the plan. Per-feature audio/storage tests were not
independently captured; normal operation is owner-reported, supplemented by ADB.

## Smallest next engineering step — proposal only

Make the existing guarded RGB565 output readable with a tiny fixed-font text
renderer and bounded status pages. Keep CPU0, D08 memory, watchdog entry and
the same framebuffer aperture. Do not initialize another display path or add
eMMC/network/USB drivers for this step.

First display a build identifier, PID, boot-stage/error code and heartbeat
counter. Then show kernel version, detected memory, CPU online set, uptime,
timer interrupt counts and a bounded selection of kernel log records. Linux
6.18 supplies userspace kernel-log access via
[/dev/kmsg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/v6.18/Documentation/ABI/testing/dev-kmsg);
use nonblocking reads with explicit record/byte limits and truncation/error
indicators, not a reader that waits forever after the last record.

Place progress markers before/after each collection operation. Current PID1
turns green, writes several proc/sysfs reports to UART, and only then enters
the heartbeat loop. Consequently a delay/block/error in that path is one
possible explanation for a persistent green screen, not a diagnosed cause.
Screen progress must not depend on draining UART; retain UART as additional
output. Define page timings and bounded writes before implementing, then
rebuild and repeat offline D08/artifact checks. A later hardware trial requires
separate authorization. No M2 or new implementation started here.

Private final logs/hashes/Android capture:
`evidence-private/20260908-y2b240-result/`, indexed in `capture-index.tsv`.
Earlier captures remain as historical checkpoints and are superseded by this
result where they describe restoration or authorization as pending.
