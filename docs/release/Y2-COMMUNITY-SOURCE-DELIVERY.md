# Source delivery and distribution gate

## Current Baseline02 delivery — 2026-10-03

Sealed package: `out/y2linux-baseline-02-candidate/` (local-only).
Compiled pair: Linux `8584ccd85f052f351fe51650b2348c83ca894ed4` / Reborn
`b71b468860233faa0a42b8448ec5777fa952b8e3`. Current exact inputs are recorded
in `metadata/versions.json`, `manifest.json` and `sources/manifest.json`.

| Delivered material | Package-relative path |
| --- | --- |
| Exact project source snapshots | `sources/Y2Linux.tar.gz`, `sources/Y2Reborn.tar.gz` |
| Locked upstream sources | `sources/linux-6.18.tar.xz`, `sources/buildroot-2025.02.18.tar.xz` |
| Collector sources/manifests/licenses and warnings | `sources/Buildroot-legal-info/` |
| Source pair and material hashes | `sources/manifest.json` |
| Actual selected package/build inventory | `validation/release-inventory.json` |
| Validation exit codes | `validation/validation-exit-codes.json` |

The current package supplies source tar archives, not the historical Git bundles.
They retain source content; they do not carry Git history or prove possession of
the original commit objects. Use the exact recorded commits in available local
repositories, or identify unpacked source snapshots honestly when reconstructing.
The fallback is the exact qualified UART01 BOOTIMG/Y2ROOT pair. Collector PASS
retains explicit Bootlin/local-package/Buildroot limitations; legal review is
incomplete and distribution remains owner-local. No byte-identical rebuild is
claimed. See [Baseline02](../validation/Y2-BASELINE-02.md) and
[current reconstruction](../build/platform-v1-reconstruction.md).


This pass distinguishes technical codec support, local engineering packaging and
permission to publish. No public-distribution approval is inferred from successful
compilation, an OSS library license, a disabled endpoint or a legal-info archive.

The preserving package records exact Linux/Reborn commits, kernel/Buildroot inputs,
root/release versions, BOOTIMG/Y2ROOT hashes, fallback identities, firmware file
expectations, platform API and delivered capabilities. The capability record lists
selected build symbols and installed configuration separately from enabled,
experimental, hardware-conditional and physically qualified state. A fresh build
never manufactures a physical qualification record.

`tools/production/privacy.py` scans the **actual ext4 image**, through read-only
host extraction, for protected/private filenames and credential/key material.
`system_update.py` refuses packaging when the scan fails. The existing partition
allowlist checks remain independent. The public-distribution check fails separately
for unapproved firmware and compiled optional codecs, even when their endpoint is
disabled. This engineering candidate remains owner-local.

For a later public release, retain and supply the exact corresponding sources,
patches, configuration and build/install scripts, not just a commit URL or a binary
SDK. Preserve copyright/license notices and include the selected packages' license
texts. Record the chosen source-delivery method and review obligations for the
actual GPL/LGPL versions and linking arrangements. Reborn's native media membrane
uses shared FFmpeg libraries; actual ELF dependencies, configuration and source
archives belong in its receipt. This is an engineering checklist, not a legal
clearance determination. The [GNU licensing FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html)
provides primary guidance; applicability and codec/patent/certification decisions
remain for the owner/legal review.

Run Buildroot `legal-info` and preserve its README warnings, manifests, source
archives and licenses. Its collection has limits: external toolchain and local
packages may require additional source material. Include the pinned Buildroot
archive itself, Linux source archive and overlays, both source snapshots/bundles,
Cargo lock/vendor checksums, exact Bootlin toolchain source expectations, codec
source ledger and local source SPDX/licenses. The
[Buildroot manual](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#legal-info)
explicitly describes the collection and its limitations.

Reconstruction uses the pinned dependency archives and adjacent clean source
checkouts described in `docs/build/platform-v1-reconstruction.md`. Current-source
kernel/Buildroot/Reborn builds and dependency closure must pass before sealing.
Source identity is reconstructable; byte-identical filesystem and complete clean
rebuild equivalence have not been demonstrated. No such claim is made.

Unresolved public decisions remain: matched MediaTek firmware/defaults rights;
AAC/aptX/aptX-HD/LDAC redistribution/certification questions from the existing
codec ledger; complete external-toolchain source delivery; release signing/channel
ownership. The owner-local candidate does not remove these features to hide the
questions.

The integration collector completed with explicit warnings for the external
Bootlin toolchain and local `y2-connectivity`/`y2-update` package license fields,
and for Buildroot itself. The package separately supplies the pinned Buildroot
archive and both exact project source archives; the collector warning README is
retained. Complete external-toolchain delivery and final local-package notice
review remain open public-release obligations.
