# Community beta feature completion implementation pass

Started 2026-10-02. This is an owner-authorized implementation campaign, not a
release qualification. No flash, device mutation, push or Git identity change.
Existing unrelated dirty documentation is preserved. All233 feature records and
release requirements remain; lower modes are fallbacks, not scope waivers.

## Source and evidence

Starting Y2Linux: `9ac2c0b7018ce707ec15f8845daf58ce38ec18a0`.
Starting Reborn: `eb64b8b21058eacb1ef183f7570cca8100cbbb46`.
Integration source Y2Linux: `02eb7359cff1d1e6eec725d496078338d1e7d601`.
Integration source Reborn: `72e94b2d8eb13dcb7e2677bff2846edec3ddf81a`.
Final documentation commits may follow these exact embedded build identities.

Read-only SSH identified installed Candidate4 (`dcbd7d1` / `b92d312`), boot
`159f7c81-ab89-4440-bc89-df827dd8bc34`, taint0. Both buses negotiate near200MHz,
but this is not integrity/endurance proof. Its PM records contain no valid current
attempt. Fix02 remains the latest broad physical qualification; candidate3's
CRC/clock observations remain the storage evidence. No stale binary is used to
certify the new source.

## Ten workstreams

| Priority | Result | Implementation and remaining gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Full resume | BLOCKED_BY_HARDWARE_PROOF | Invalid cold SRAM evidence suppressed; typed sleep lifecycle and exact same-boot/kernel-exit/Reborn restoration contract added. Actual post-SPM stall still unlocalized. Existing Fix03 breadcrumbs cover the interval. New RTC/Power trace required. |
| 2 C2/C3 | BLOCKED_BY_HARDWARE_PROOF | Existing C2 baseline/runtime-clock corrections and C3 runtime PCM/vector/deadline path retained. No source-backed reason to weaken ownership/topology/domain predicates. Natural C2 and controlled C3 entry/resume await hardware; C3 remains disabled by default. |
| 3 Storage | PARTIAL | Search all32 tuning taps/windows; restore failed latch clock; runtime retune failure schedules claimed-worker timing renegotiation, with payload rejection until safe mode. Production lab mutations removed. HS200 and200MHz SDR104 remain intended ceilings; sustained integrity/fallback/hotplug/resume proof pending. |
| 4 USB/power | PARTIAL | Retain Fix03 progress-aware DMA guard, PIO/off fallback and conservative charger/low-voltage policy. No new unobserved hardware defect invented. Product shutdown/save path preserved. Exact stock current/coulomb functions are stubs; NTC/sense wiring/calibration unproven. Loaded USB and electrical tests pending. |
| 5 Native24 | PARTIAL | Fixed real userspace S32 mapping/constraint negotiation and tested packed24→FFmpeg→floatDSP→S24/S32 low bits. Exact MT6582 wider DL1/AFE path remains unproven, so native wired24 remains NOT_IMPLEMENTED. Source/electrical capture procedure prepared. |
| 6 Native high rates | BLOCKED_BY_HARDWARE_PROOF | Exact research does not establish safe MT6582/Y2 PLL/divider/rate programming. No adjacent-SoC constants copied.44.1/48 native;88.2→44.1 and96→48 conversion remains. Requirement retained; not declared impossible. |
| 7 Classic codecs | PARTIAL | All viable encoder endpoints privately integrated; actual SBC-XQ bitpool and LDAC bitrate/ABR counters, persisted requested/effective quality, bounded qualified/history/load-aware Auto and reconnect preferences. Peer/RF/thermal/coexistence proof and optional-codec distribution clearance remain. |
| 8 Reborn | PARTIAL | Productv2 wheel-friendly EQ, truthful source/output details, typed sleep/refusal, codec preference versus actual state, SBC-only quality, saved once-per-connection preference, estimatedSOC and diagnostic export. Ready-frame splash/shutdown preserved.238 host tests, fmt and strictClippy pass; physical UX/restoration proof pending. |
| 9 Tester operations | PARTIAL | Fresh personal-key data seed, separate redacted export/retrieval, music guide, preserving update/recovery guide, one guarded SSH/Wi-Fi harness. Host first-owner/privacy tests pass; actual first install/update/recovery rehearsal pending. |
| 10 Release composition | PARTIAL | Actual-config capability/source manifests, whole-image private-byte rejection including deleted keys, protected extras rejection, fail-closed public gate, pinned source/legal-info delivery tooling. Final build/package receipts below; legal review remains open. |

## Precise capability conclusions

Full resume: no verified root cause or corrective post-SPM fix. Existing RTC and
Power wake source paths plus retained-vector/kernel/device breadcrumbs are ready
for a decision run. Source can recognize complete restoration; restoration itself
is not proven. Normal product deep sleep refuses until qualified; the explicit
owner diagnostic helper remains available. Charger refusal, CONSYS one isolated
retry, USB protections and safe abort/unwind remain.

C2 requires naturally idle owned clocks and valid timers. C3 additionally requires
CPU0-only topology/secondaries physically off, admitted lowOPP, idle media/radio
and bus domains, armed CIRQ, future GPT4 deadline, valid PCM/vector/context and
exact restoration. Read-only observation still blocked by highOPP/domains/clocks.
`y2.cpuidle=off`, `y2.deep_idle=off`, `y2.cpu_safe=1` remain.

Wired output currently remains S16_LE,16 meaningfulbits,32-bit I2S slots/64fs,
16-bit DAC payload.44.1/48 are native;88.2/96 are family-converted. User-space
S32 support is not a native24 hardware claim. Physical low-bit/rate fixture is
`tools/platform/audio_precision.py`; source register evidence is required first.

Battery remains estimatedSOC.70/450/650mA ceilings,4.175V target, charger hold,
termination/recharge guards, low/critical handling and3.4V hard floor remain
conservative. Shutdown saves Reborn, stops audio, closes SQLite and syncs. Real
pack-current/coulomb/NTC units are not exposed without wiring/calibration proof.

| Codec/policy | Built/enabled/integrated | Software evidence | Physical/distribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SBC | yes | encoder/endpoint/observedPCM | candidate peer/reconnect pending; notices required |
| SBC XQ | SBC quality policy, user-selectable | dual-channel bitpool38/47 recognized | compatible peer and link margin pending; same SBC source obligations |
| AAC | yes, private experimental | real encoder44.1/48 and endpoint contracts | peer/CPU/thermal pending; distribution unresolved |
| aptX | yes, private experimental | separate real encoder contract | peer/CPU/thermal pending; distribution unresolved |

| LDAC qualities | yes |303/606/909 and330/660/990 family mapping | RF/quality comparison pending; LDAC distribution gate |
| LDAC ABR | yes | actual library queue-driven adaptation plus exported counters | over-air adaptation/coexistence still pending |
| Auto | yes | bounded attempts→SBC, actual/preference separate, bounded history, no PCM-generation flapping | qualification-driven promotion and real peers pending |

## Validation and candidate

Final current-source validation and artifact receipts follow. No RC or
feature-complete qualification is asserted by this implementation report.

## Sealed integration handoff

Verdict: **READY FOR HARDWARE DECISION RUN**. Feature completion remains open;
this is not an integrated RC or public beta. Candidate:
`out/y2linux-community-beta-feature-completion-candidate/`.

Fresh source: Linux `02eb7359cff1d1e6eec725d496078338d1e7d601`;
Reborn `72e94b2d8eb13dcb7e2677bff2846edec3ddf81a`. Kernel `6.18.0-y2linux-feature-completion-01`,
Buildroot2025.02.18, root `2025.02.18-platform-v1.16`, API1/featurecontract2.

BOOTIMG SHA256: `060145e3931e1d23f0b9805c0f12417d47f1589cf4489010705876a1ade7b098`.
Y2ROOT SHA256: `2039d61e30bd02d0f3fd8006808e7dbc95bbaabce7f1834fa12d57bcccd81995`.

Software: fresh kernel/config/DT/modules/ABI and Buildroot/Reborn ARM build;
production suite 345PASS/5environmentSKIP (350collected),
all5 environment-skipped cases PASS on the host, Reborn238PASS, fmt and
strictClippy PASS. ARM/QEMU, installed Python/SQLite/ALSA/codec contracts,
FFmpeg checks, ELF/dependency closure, configuration/codec inventory, package
validation, actual-image privacy scans and protected partitions pass. Individual
logs and exit codes are retained in `validation/`; skips are listed in the
production log and are not hardware passes. Real encoder contract covers12cases;
software LDAC ABR is exercised with synthetic queue pressure, not RF loss.

`manifest.json`, `metadata/release-composition.json`,
`metadata/delivered-capabilities.json`, `sources/manifest.json` and SHA256SUMS
bind the payload/source/configuration identities. `sources/` includes exact Git
archives, pinned Linux/Buildroot and legal-info sources/licenses/limitations.
Collector success is not legal clearance; optional codecs and owner firmware
remain public-distribution blockers. Public packaging fails closed.

Next owner action: flash only this paired BOOTIMG/Y2ROOT with
`MT6582_preserve_data_scatter.txt`, preserving Y2DATA. Do not select any protected
partition or data initialization. Then use the single integrated harness:

```sh
python3 tools/development/qualify-feature-completion.py \
  --package out/y2linux-community-beta-feature-completion-candidate \
  --host y2 --wifi-host y2-wifi --run --exercise --sleep
```

The two preconfigured verified SSH aliases must address the same player through
USB and independent Wi-Fi. It gates sleep on awake/retention checks and prompts
only for unavoidable physical actions. Codec peers, I2S/electrical equipment and
installation/update/recovery choices remain explicit owner-dependent cases, not
automatic passes. Private harness evidence stays separate from redacted exports.
